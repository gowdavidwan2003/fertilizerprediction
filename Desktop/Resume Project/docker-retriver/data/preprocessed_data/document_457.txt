Summary Draft Article 286 (Article 320, Constitution of India 1950) was discussed in the Assembly on 23 August, 1949. The Draft Article laid down the functions of the Public Service Commission. The Drafting Committee Chairman moved to substitute the Draft Article with a version that had two new clauses. One was a proviso to the third clause that laid down the matters which required the consultation of the Service Commissions. The second one required the regulations made by the Public Service Commission to be laid before each House of the Parliament. One Member moved an amendment to delete clause (2) of the Draft Article which stated that the Union Public Service Commission should assist in framing and operating schemes of joint recruitment for which candidates with special qualifications are required. He believed that the clause was redundant and was covered in a previous Article. Another Member wanted to amend the clause which stated that the Public Service Commissions should be consulted on all matter about the recruitment to civil services and posts. He felt that this clause and the criteria for examinations would keep away the general masses from the civil services and benefit only a small part of the population. A few other amendments were also raised in the discussion surrounding this Draft Article. However, the Assembly did not pass any of them. The amended version of the Draft Article that was moved by the Drafting Committee Chairman was adopted by the Assembly on the same day.
