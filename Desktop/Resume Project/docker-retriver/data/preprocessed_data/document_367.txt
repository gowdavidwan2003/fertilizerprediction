Summary Draft Article 67 (5) to (7) was debated on 4 January 1949 and 17 October 1949. It established the composition of the House of the People. A member proposed to replace single-member constituency, with a ‘system of proportional representation with multi-member constituencies by means of cumulative vote’. He argued that the former perpetuated a democracy of majority which was tyrannical. The system of proportional representation would ensure that voices from diverse sectors were heard. Moreover, the single-member constituency system would not guarantee protection to minority communities. He relied on the Irish experience to demonstrate how religious minorities were disenfranchised by the majority. Another member supported this move and believed that proportional representation would ensure ‘greater reflection of popular will’. A similar amendment was moved to encode proportional representation. The mover called the Parliamentary democratic system a defect in electoral democracy. However, the members of the Drafting Committee were not convinced by this proposal. A member cited practical reasons to oppose this: India’s population was too excessive to conduct elections through proportional representation. And the literacy rate was far too low for this system to succeed. The Chairman relied on the English example: the British categorically dismissed proportional representation as it would adversely impact the stability of governments. Instead, minority representation could be promised through the reservation in the legislature. A member sought to introduce illiteracy as a ground for disqualification to vote for the first ten years of the Constitution being in force. He argued that this could drive adult education and would increase the literacy rate. The aforementioned proposal fell through. The Assembly accepted a few other amendments and adopted the Draft Article on 4th January 1949. It was reopened for discussions and amended on 17th October 1949.
