SUMMARY Draft Article 265 (Article 287, Constitution of India 1950) was discussed in the Assembly on 9 September 1949. This Draft Article prohibited States from imposing taxes on sale and consumption of electricity by the Union Government and Union Railways. The Parliament was empowered to permit States to impose taxes on sale of electricity to the Union provided the final price for such sale is lesser than the price offered to other consumers. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed a minor amendment to substitute ‘any railways’ in place of ‘Union railways’. The Assembly adopted this amendment without any debate. Another member proposed that Parliament should not be given any power to make a law to permit the States to impose such taxes. However, the Assembly rejected this amendment without any debate. Draft Article 265, as amended was adopted on 9 September 1949.
