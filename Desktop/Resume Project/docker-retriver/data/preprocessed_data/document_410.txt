SUMMARY Draft Article 255 (Article 275, Constitution of India 1950) was discussed on 8 August 1949 and 9 August 1949. It empowered Parliament to make law to provide financial assistance to States in the form of grants-in-aid charged to the revenue of India. The Draft Article also mandated that States which were erstwhile British provinces would be compensated for their expenditure on promoting the welfare of Scheduled Tribes and administering Scheduled Areas. Assam was also to be provided grants-in-aid for administering tribal areas specified in Part I of the Sixth Schedule. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed minor amendments to this Draft Article. First, to change the phrase ‘revenues of India’ to ‘Consolidated Fund of India’. Second, to include all States for the mandatory provision of compensation for expenditure on Scheduled Tribes and tribal areas. Third, to change the manner of calculating grants-in-aid to be given to Assam. Some Members opposed the Draft Article as it empowered the Parliament to make laws on financial assistance given to States. They believed that it would cause conflict among representatives of various States. A Member proposed that President should determine the grants-in-aid to be provided to States. Some Members raised concerns in relation to the constitution of tribal areas. The Draft Article refers to the powers of State governments to administer tribal areas however, the constitution of tribal areas was yet to be decided. A member proposed that this Draft Article should be discussed after tribal areas have been constituted and that all the tribal areas should be integrated into one province and administered by an autonomous body under the Union government – this would be in line with principles of self-determination. After heated discussions, the Assembly adopted the amendments. A Member moved a minor amendment to the amendment proposed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee to provide that until the Parliament determines by law the amount to be distributed to States, the President would have the discretion to allocate grants-in-aid to the States. This amendment was adopted. Draft Article 255 as amended, was adopted on 9 August 1949. Article 275 was amended in 1969 through the Constitution (Twenty-second Amendment) Act, 1969 to include autonomous States as well.
