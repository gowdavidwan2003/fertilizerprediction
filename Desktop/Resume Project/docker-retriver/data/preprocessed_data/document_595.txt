Summary This article was not a part of the initial Draft Constitution, 1948. It was introduced by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee as an amendment on 18 May 1949. It laid down qualifications for membership of the Parliament. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee clarified the purpose of this provision. He noted that while any voter qualified to stand for elections, he/she must meet certain ‘higher’ qualifications. A Parliamentarian should have experience and knowledge to discharge his/her responsibilities effectively. Encoding these additional qualifications will ensure better candidates at the Parliament. A significant proposal was to reduce the age limit from 35 to 30 for members to the House of People. The mover of this amendment argued that ‘wisdom does not depend on age’. With education younger citizens had more civic awareness. Moreover, she pointed out how Jawaharlal Nehru was appointed as the President of Congress at a young age. On 18 May 1949, the Assembly adopted the Draft Article with the amendment to reduce the age limit.
