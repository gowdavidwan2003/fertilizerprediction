In this clip, Masani is heard making a powerful speech in favour of the Objectives Resolution moved by Jawaharlal Nehru. M.R. Masani, popularly called Minoo Masani, was one of the key socialist members in the Constituent Assembly, elected from Bombay on a Congress ticket. Though he made only a handful of interventions in the Assembly debates, these were notable contributions to the debates and unambiguously projected his socialist positioning.
