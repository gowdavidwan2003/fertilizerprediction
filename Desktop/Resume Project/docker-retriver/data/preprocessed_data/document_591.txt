Summary Draft Article 99 (Article 120) was debated on 17 September 1949. It prescribed Hindi and English as the languages to be used in the Parliament, with exceptions for members who could not express themselves adequately in either language. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an Amendment to substantially modify the Draft Article. The debates in the Assembly were based on this Amendment. A member proposed that clause (1) be amended to include Bengali or any other regional language as an alternative to Hindi and English. He argued that members of Parliament might be prohibited from speaking in their mother tongue since the proviso to clause (1) gave the Speaker of the House the discretion to permit the use of regional languages. The member later withdrew his amendment from consideration. The Assembly accepted the Drafting Committee’s amendment and adopted the Draft Article on 17 September 1949.
