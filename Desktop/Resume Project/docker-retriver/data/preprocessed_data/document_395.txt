SUMMARY Draft Article 238 (Article 261, Constitution of India 1950) was first discussed on 13 June 1949. It deals with the legitimacy of public acts, records and judicial proceedings. It bestowed legitimacy on Union and State public acts, records and judicial proceedings. The value of these records as evidence would be determined by legislation. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed two amendments. The first allowed for only the Union law to decided the value of the records. The second proposed that princely states should also be subject to the provisions of the Draft Article. The proposed amendments were accepted without discussion. Draft Article 238, as amended was adopted on 13 June 1949.
