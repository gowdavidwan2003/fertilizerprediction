Summary Draft Article 39 (Article 49) was debated on 24 November 1948. While preservation of history was deemed significant in general, there was no substantial debate on the question. An amendment to add the term ‘disfigurement‘ was moved, and accepted. The amended Draft Article was adopted on the same day, that is 24 November 1948. The phrase ‘under law made by Parliament’ was later inserted by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956.
