Summary Draft Article 67(8) (Article 82) was debated on 4 January 1949. It provided for the Parliament to readjust, after completion of each census, seats allocated to the House of the People to the States and division of each State into territorial constituencies. A member moved an amendment to insert ‘on the basis of population’ after the word ‘readjusted’. He urged that readjustment should be on the basis of population. This amendment was defeated. Another member moved an amendment which proposed to add a proviso to ensure that readjustment would not occur until the dissolution of the existing House. He argued that it would be difficult to readjust existing legislatures and it should begin only after subsequent elections. This amendment was adopted. The Constituent Assembly adopted this article with amendments on 4 January 1949.
