Summary Draft Article 1 (Article 1 of Constitution of India 1950) was debated on 15 and 17 November 1948, and 17 and 18 September 1949. The Draft Article declared India as a ‘Union of States’ and went on to define India’s territory. Most members were confused as to why India was described as a ‘Union of States’, instead of a ‘Federation’ which was more appropriate. While presenting the Draft Constitution on an earlier date, the Drafting Committee Chairman had explained that ‘Union of States’ was used to ensure and clarify that States did not have the right to secede from India. A Member wanted to rename ‘India‘ to ‘Bharat’ as the latter had more historical pedigree. Another Member introduced an amendment to use both ‘India’ and ‘Bharat’ in the Draft Article. The Drafting Committee Chairman had through an amendment, suggested that the Draft Article say ‘India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States’. Except for one member who found the phrasing inelegant, the amendment won the support of the house. The Assembly rejected all amendments to the Draft Article except those introduced by Drafting Committee Chairman. It adopted the Draft Article on 18 September 1949.
