Summary Draft Article 97 (Article 117) was debated on 10 June 1949. It laid out special procedural provisions relating to the passage of financial bills. A member proposed that clause 3 of the Draft Article should be amended to prevent the government from spending any money in war-like operations outside the territory of India. This could be allowed only when the President sought authorization from the Parliament after providing his reasons in writing. He contended that this would not hinder the ability of the state to defend itself, instead would act as a check on the government’s unfettered spending on wars. In response, it was argued this amendment would limit the executive’s power in defending the nation’s frontiers and integrity. Another member proposed the deletion of clause 3 of the Draft Article. He argued that this clause could be strictly interpreted to mean that no Bill could be moved in either house of the Parliament unless on the recommendation of the President, as every Bill would require some government expenditure. In response, a member proposed the amendment of clause 3 to clarify that it would only apply where funds were sought from the Consolidated Fund of India. The aforementioned proposals were voted in negative. The Assembly accepted minor changes proposed by the Drafting Committee and adopted the Draft Article on 10 June 1949.
