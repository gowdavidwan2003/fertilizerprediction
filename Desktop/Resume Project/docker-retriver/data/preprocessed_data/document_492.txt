(2) For the purposes of clause (1), each State shall be divided into territorial constituencies in such manner that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it shall, so far as practicable, be the same throughout the State. Explanation.—In this clause, the expression “population” means the population as ascertained at the last preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published: Provided that the reference in this Explanation to the last preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published shall, until the relevant figures for the first census taken after the year 2026 have been published, be construed as a reference to the 2001 census.

Summary Draft Article 149 (Article 170) was debated on 6, 7 and 8 January, and on 14 October 1949. It laid out the composition of the State Legislative Assemblies. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to the proviso to clause (3), which would set the minimum and maximum limits on representatives as 60 and 450 respectively. A member of the Drafting Committee proposed that there should be one representative for every 75,000 residents. The Chairman withdrew his amendment, while the one proposed by the member of the Drafting Committee was accepted. Another member then proposed the exclusion of the autonomous districts of Assam and the Cantonment and Municipality of Shillong from this clause. This was supported by another member, who argued that the current Draft Article would disenfranchise tribal people living in an area with a significant non-tribal population. This amendment was accepted by the Assembly. A number of other amendments were negatived and withdrawn. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 8 January 1949. Subsequently, a member of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to delete clause (2), which had become unnecessary as the Assembly had now adopted Draft Article 289B (Article 326) which dealt with elections to State Legislatures. The same member also proposed an amendment to bestow the powers under clause (4) on Parliament, instead of the State Legislatures, because the same powers had been given to Parliament under Draft Article 290 (Article 327). Both amendments were adopted on 14 October 1949.
