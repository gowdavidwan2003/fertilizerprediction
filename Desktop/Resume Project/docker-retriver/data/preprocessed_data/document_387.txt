SUMMARY Draft Article 232 (Article 255) was discussed on 13 June 1949. The Draft Article stated that no law will be invalid only because certain procedural requirements under the Constitution weren’t fulfilled. It gave alternatives to fulfil such procedural sanctions. (For instance, Article 274 requires the recommendation of the President for moving Bills affecting taxation in which States are interested. In case this procedure is not followed, the Act can still be valid, if the Presidents assents to it.) There was no substantive debate on this Article and it was adopted on the same day. Article 255 was further amended by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956.
