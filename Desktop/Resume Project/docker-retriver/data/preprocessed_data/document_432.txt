Summary Draft Article 270A (Article 295, of India 1950) was not included in the Draft Constitution 1948. It was introduced by the Drafting Committee Chairman on 13 October 1949. Draft Article 270A dealt with the property and assets of Princely States. It stated that all assets, property and contractual rights and obligations of Princely States would be transferred to the Union government after the commencement of the Constitution. One Member wanted Parliament to approve this transfer in order to ‘maintain the final authority of Parliament’. The Assembly rejected this amendment without any debate and adopted the Draft Article 270A on the same day.
