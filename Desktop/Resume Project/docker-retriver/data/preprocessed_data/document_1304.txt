Aundh State Constitution Act 1939 Archives - Constitution of India Home ≫ Historical Constitutions ≫ Aundh State Constitution Act 1939 HISTORICAL CONSTITUTIONS Aundh State Constitution Act 1939 Remarks In late November 1938, M.K. Gandhi momentarily set aside his spinning wheel to focus on a different task. “I am just now engaged in hammering into shape the Aundh Constitution,” he wrote in a letter to his secretary, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur. Gandhi was not alone. “The Raja Saheb’s son is a delightful boy.”, continued Gandhi. The ‘boy’ was Apasaheb Pant, the son of Raja Bhavan Rao Pant, the ruler of the Princely State of Aundh (present-day Satara, Maharashtra). Also in the room was Maurice Frydman, a Polish-Jewish engineer and close aide to Gandhi. Together, this trio, working from Gandhi’s Wardha Ashram, drafted the Aundh State Constitution. The Raja had visited the Ashram a few days earlier, seeking Gandhi’s assistance in drafting a constitution for his princely state. An ardent admirer of Gandhi’s philosophy, the Raja had recently announced his intention to relinquish his divine right to rule and instead grant full self-government to his people—a revolutionary decision for a princely ruler. This move was the culmination of years of incremental reforms, including the establishment of representative bodies in villages. Known for his eccentricities, including his prolific writings on bodybuilding and his invention of the Surya Namaskar, this decision to step down was perhaps the most significant of the Raja’s many accomplishments. Gandhi eagerly embraced the project, seeing it as a chance to implement his vision of villages as self-sufficient administrative and economic units – something that had struggled to gain traction with the Indian National Congress and later in the Indian Constituent Assembly. Alongside the Raja’s son and Frydman, Gandhi and his team worked to finalize the constitution by the end of the year. The document was introduced to the Aundh State Assembly and ratified on January 21, 1939, officially making Aundh a constitutional republic—though not entirely, as we shall see. The Constitution remained in effect until 1947, when Aundh joined the Indian Union. The Aundh State Constitution was a brief document, spanning around four pages with 27 articles. Written in a legal style typical of legislative acts, it began by reaffirming the Raja’s intention to “grant full self-government to his subjects” and swiftly moved into substantive provisions. Article 2 granted freedoms of speech, press, assembly, worship, and non-discrimination, along with universal free compulsory education. These provisions revealed bright traces of the Congress-authored historical constitutions like the Nehru Report and the Karachi Resolution, but with notable differences. For instance, these freedoms are not explicitly termed “rights,” and while the Nehru and Karachi reports limited freedoms by “public order and morality,” the Aundh Constitution adds a Gandhian nuance by subjecting them to “non-violence and public morality. Gandhi’s influence is most evident in the Aundh Constitution’s highly decentralized government structure. The village or town Panchayat is established as the core administrative unit, responsible for local governance, including education, welfare, and infrastructure. Panchayats possessed significant judicial powers, overseen by a High Court. These Panchayats reported to Taluka Councils, composed of Panchayat Presidents, which manage state revenue and budget reviews. The Legislative Assembly, with 15 members including Taluka Council Presidents, elected representatives, and five nominees of the Raja, formed the legislature alongside the Raja. Surprisingly, the Constitution did not provide for universal adult franchise; only literate individuals are eligible to vote. A closer examination reveals that the Raja’s grant of self-government was not as straightforward as it appears. Despite his apparent step back, the Raja retained substantial influence, particularly from Article 24 onwards. He held extraordinary powers, including defining Aundh’s relationship with the British Crown and other princely states, convening extraordinary legislative sessions, suspending the government for maladministration, and appointing the Prime Minister and Ministers, along with holding residuary powers. Nonetheless, the ratification of the Aundh Constitution was widely celebrated across India as a victory of self-government. Nehru, reflecting on it a year later, observed that unlike other princely states, Aundh lacked an oppressive atmosphere. He suggested that the Constitution had a psychological impact, particularly at the village level, where Panchayats made justice swifter and more affordable. Nehru also noted that this represented ‘true training in democracy.’ Significant changes were also seen in education, with the establishment of nearly 27 new schools in the five years following the Constitution’s ratification and a marked increase in educational staff and expenditure. We do not have sufficient information from the archives on how the British reacted to the Aundh Constitution. That said, we do know that the British were wary of the Raja’s motivations in the late 1930s, his nationalist inclinations, and his close ties with Indian leaders like Gandhi, which earned him the label of ‘the rebel against the Raj.’ Until recently, the Aundh Constitution has garnered attention primarily from scholars interested in the state’s political history and Gandhian political thought. They have viewed this moment as either a novel experiment in grassroots democracy or a demonstration of Gandhian principles in action. The Constitution is notably absent from the works of scholars who have traced antecedents to the Constitution of India 1950, such as Niraja Jayal and Rohit De, and is only briefly mentioned (in a footnote) by Austin Granville. However, scholarly interest is growing. Tejas Parasher highlights the Aundh Constitution as an example of ‘radical democracy’ in Indian political thought, presenting an alternative to the Westminster model favored by the Congress Party. Rohit De and Ornit Shani have also noted Aundh among the princely states engaged in constitution-making, and it is expected to feature prominently in their forthcoming book. The Aundh State Constitution is a notable document in Indian constitutional history for a simple yet profound reason: it was the only Indian-authored Historical Constitution that was actually implemented, unlike the aspirational Nehru Report or Karachi Resolution. Further, it granted significant self-government to the people of a princely state—a remarkable development for its time. However, any claim that this was India’s first republican constitution, as many have suggested, must be tempered by the fact that the Raja retained substantial powers, and his son served as Aundh’s first Prime Minister, underscoring the enduring influence of the royal family. In this the Aundh State Constitution appears to be in familiar company with the Government of Mysore Act 1940. AUNDH STATE CONSTITUTION ACT 1 OF 1939.
