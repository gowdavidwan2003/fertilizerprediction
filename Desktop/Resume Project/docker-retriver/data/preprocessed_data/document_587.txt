Summary Draft Article 98 (Article 118) was debated on 10 June 1949. It enabled each house of the Parliament to make its own rules of procedure. A member proposed that clause (4) of the Draft Article should allow for the Chairman of the Council of States to lead the joint sitting of the Parliament in case of the Speaker’s absence. He argued that as the rules of procedure were framed by the President in consultation with the Chairman of the Council of States, the latter would find it difficult and embarrassing to propose his/her own name. Therefore, even though the Chairman was the most appropriate person to preside in the absence of the Speaker, he/she would be unlikely to do so without an explicit provision. Several other members responded that as the Chairman was also the Vice-President of India, the amendment was highly improper as it seemingly put the Vice-President below the Speaker. The amendment was subsequently withdrawn and the Assembly adopted the Draft Article on 10 June 1949.
