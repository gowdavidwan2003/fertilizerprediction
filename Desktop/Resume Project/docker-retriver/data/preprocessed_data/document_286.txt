Summary Article 13 (Draft Article 8) was debated in the Constituent Assembly on the 25, 26 and 29 November 1948. It declared that any existing law at the commencement of the Constitution that is inconsistent with Part III would be void. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to explicitly define the terms ‘law’ and ‘laws in force’. One member wanted the deletion of the words ‘custom or usage’ from the language of this amendment, arguing that it permitted the State, rather than people, to create custom. Although the Chairman clarified that this was not the case, he moved an alternate amendment to remove any doubts in interpretation, which was accepted without debate. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 29 November 1948.
