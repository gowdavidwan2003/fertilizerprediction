Summary Draft Article 203 (Article 224) was debated on 15 June and 16 October 1949. It gave the High Courts the power of superintendence over all courts within their jurisdiction. The Chairman of the Drafting Constitution proposed that the heading of the Article be changed to ‘Power of superintendence over all courts by the High Court’. In response, a member argued that the term ‘over all courts’ was redundant. The Assembly accepted the Chairman’s amendment. The amended Draft Article was initially adopted on 15 June 1949. Subsequently, a member of the Drafting Committee proposed to add clause (4) to the Draft Article, which clarified that the High Court’s power of superintendence would not extend to any court or tribunal of the Armed Forces. He stated that this clause had been introduced at the behest of the Defence Ministry. The amendment was accepted without any debate on 16 October 1949.
