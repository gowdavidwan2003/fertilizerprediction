SUMMARY Draft Article 226 (Article 249, Constitution of India, 1950) was debated on 13 June,1949. This provision created an exception to the federal structure adopted in the Constitution. It permitted the Union Parliament to make laws on subjects in the state list if authorised by the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) to do so in national interest. First, some members felt that the Draft Article was not necessary: They believed that the States would themselves pass such laws in national interest. Second, a the Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed an amendment to state that the law passed by the Union Parliament will be valid for one year unless it is extended by the Rajya Sabha. In response to this proposed amendment, some members urged that the amendment reduced the impact of the Draft Article by imposing a strict time period. In the end, the Assembly accepted the amendment. Draft Article 226 (as amended) was adopted on 13 June1949. Subsequently, Article 249 was amended in 2016 clarifying that the Union Parliament may make laws on goods and services tax under this provision.
