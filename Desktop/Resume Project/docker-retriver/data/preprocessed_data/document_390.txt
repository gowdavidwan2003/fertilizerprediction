SUMMARY Draft Article 229 (Article 252, Constitution of India 1950) was debated on 13 June 1949. It permitted Parliament to make laws on a subject matter that it does not have the power to make laws on, if one or more State Legislatures passed a resolution to that effect. One member suggested that the Draft Article be amended to allow for the Union Parliament and the State Legislature to repeal or amend the laws made under this Draft Article. In response, another member clarified the Draft Article as it stood allowed for this. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee himself moved another amendment which proposed that Parliament could exercise power under the Draft Article only if two or more (rather than one or more) States jointly passed a resolution to that effect. This amendment was accepted. Draft Article 229 was adopted on 13th June 1949.
