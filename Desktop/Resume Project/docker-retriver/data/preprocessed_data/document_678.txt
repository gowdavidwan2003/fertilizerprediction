SUMMARY Draft Article 306 was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 7 October 1949. The Draft Article was first among the Constitution’s ‘temporary and transitory provisions’. It gave Parliament the power to legislate on a few select subjects in the State List like cotton and woollen textiles, foodstuffs, coal and iron as if they were subjects in the Concurrent List. This applied for a period of five years after the Constitution came into force. A Member noted that the Draft Article aimed to smoothen the economic difficulties that would accompany India’s transition to an independent State. Citing the international economics crisis, he moved an amendment to increase the Draft Article’s time limit from 5 to 15 years. The Drafting Committee Chairman dismissed the amendment without any discussion. Another Member wanted to bring charcoal and firewood under the Draft Article’s ambit as these were vulnerable to the economic crisis. The Union government, he added, must have the power to control the prices of these commodities. Though the Drafting Committee Chairman was open to the suggestion, the amendment was not accepted by the Assembly. The Draft Article as amended by the Drafting Committee Chairman was adopted by the Constitution on 7 October 1949.
