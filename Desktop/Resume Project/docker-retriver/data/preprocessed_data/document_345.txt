Summary Draft Article 44 was debated in the Constituent Assembly on 13 December 1948. It laid down the procedures related to the election of the President of India. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee pointed out that in order to achieve ‘uniformity in the scale of representation of the different States’, the Draft Article adopted the proportional representation through single transferable vote approach. He noted that if each member of the electoral college was given one vote, that would not be truly representative. There was opposition to the proportional system that the Draft Article put forth. A member moved an amendment to remove the mention of proportional representation in the Draft Article. She believed that proportional representation was generally used in contexts where there was a ‘multiple-member constituency’ – something that was not the case for Presidential elections. Another member noted that proportional representation system with a single transferable vote, was historically used for elections with more than one seat – it would not be practical to adopt this system for the election of a President. In response to the general objections to the proportional representation system, the Chairman of the Assembly argued that there were no better alternatives. Elections through direct majority would not take into account the voices of the minority communities and parties and separate electorates was a system that the Constitution had rejected. The ‘proportional representation’ system was the only guarantee against majority dominance. The Constituent Assembly adopted the Draft Article on 13 December 1948 with minor amendments.
