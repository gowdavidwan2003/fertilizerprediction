Summary Draft Article 32 (Article 41) was debated on 23 November 1948. It directed the State to make provisions for adequate employment and educational opportunities, and social assistance for certain vulnerable groups. One member moved an amendment to include ‘medical relief’ among the other social amenities. He also urged the rephrasing of ‘undeserved want’ to ‘deserving relief’. Another member pointed out that the right to medical relief is already provided for under Draft Article 38 (Article 47). It would be unnecessary to repeat it in this Draft Article. The Assembly adopted this article on 23 November 1948 without amendments.
