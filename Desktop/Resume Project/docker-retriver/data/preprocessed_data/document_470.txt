SUMMARY Draft Article 292 (Article 330 of Constitution of India 1950) was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 23 August 1949 and 24 August 1949. It granted reservation of seats for Muslims, Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) (from British provinces) and Indian Christians (from Madras and Bombay) in the Lok Sabha. The Drafting Committee Chairman proposed to replace this Draft Article to only provide reservation of seats for SCs, STs (excluding Tribes from Assam) and STs from autonomous districts in Assam in the Lok Sabha. Reservation of seats would be proportional the population of SCs and STs in each state. The amendment was introduced to implement the recommendation of the Advisory Committee to abolish reservation of seats for minorities except SCs and STs. A Member supported the amendment to provide reservation for SCs and STs due to their adverse socio-economic conditions. However, he was concerned that the SCs in Assam would not have any representation due to the decrease in their population after partition. The President clarified that there was no requirement of having a minimum population. Another Member proposed that reserved seats should be allotted to constituencies that have a relatively high population of SCs and STs in the concerned state. He believed that the apprehension in the minds of SCs and STs regarding their welfare can be fully addressed only if a more SCs and STs have a more influential voice in electing their representative. This could be achieved by having SC and ST MPs from constituencies with a large SC or ST population. A Member wanted to clarify that members of the SC and ST community could contest in unreserved seats as well. The Drafting Committee Chairman responded by stating that the law on elections would address this issue. On the other hand, another Member wanted to prohibit STs from Assam contesting in unreserved seats. A Member objected to criticism levied against reservation for the SC and ST community and stated that it was merely a measure to atone for the undemocratic conduct of the upper caste community. There were several minor amendments moved that were opposed by the Drafting Committee Chairman. All the amendments except the Drafting Committee Chairman’s proposal were either withdrawn or rejected. The Draft Article as amended by the Drafting Committee Chairman was adopted on 24 August 1949. Article 330 was amended in 1956, 1973 and 2001 to include Union Territories, calculation of reserved seats in autonomous districts of Assam and the meaning of population. Reserved seats for STs in autonomous districts of Assam would be calculated based on the ratio of the population of STs in these districts to the total population of Assam. Population would mean the population according to the last preceding census.
