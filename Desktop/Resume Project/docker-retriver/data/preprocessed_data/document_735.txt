It contains the affirmations and oaths to be taken by those holding the post of Union Minister, State Minister, Member of Parliament, Member of State Legislature, Supreme Court and High Court Judge. This Schedule generated some debate in the Constituent Assembly—primarily on the matter of invoking God’s name in the oaths and affirmations. The Drafting Committee Chairman introduced an amendment to provide persons with the option of swearing in in the name of ‘God’. An Assembly member opposed this move on ethical and religious grounds. Curiously, the member insisted that since God was not a member of the Assembly and nor was his consent taken, the word ‘God’ could not be incorporated in the oath. Another member added that the people in these posts would be carrying out secular functions—it would not make sense to ask them to take God’s name while swearing in. He also reasoned that in politics one would have to do irreligious things and hence, the inclusion of ‘God’ was out of place. A few members of the Assembly were also particular that the swearing in should precede the affirmation which did not invoke ‘God’. They believed that placing ‘God’ later implied that it was somehow less in importance. One member emphatically pushed for this change, adamant that a Constitution made to the liking of the Indian masses should have an oath that begins with the swearing in in the name of ‘God’. An amendment ensuring this change was eventually accepted by the Assembly. The Third Schedule, as amended by the Assembly, was adopted into the Constitution on 26 August 1949. The Schedule was reopened for discussion on 16 October 1949, but no significant changes were made.
