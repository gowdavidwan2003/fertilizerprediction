Key Speeches While discussing the compensation to be provided to landowners upon government acquisition, Rao suggested that the clause be amended to ensure that nominal compensation is paid for land acquisition by the government since such acquisition would be in the interest of the public and for public benefit. On equality, Rao proposed adding ‘schools’ and ‘temples’ to a clause that described the various public establishments in which discrimination based on religion, race, caste and sex should not be allowed. He noted that in schools, there was a possibility of segregation in seating and added that in temples, discrimination often took place by way of non-admission of untouchables.
