Key Speeches During the discussion around Draft Article 5A (Article 6 of the Constitution of India – which deals with principles of citizenship of persons who migrated from Pakistan to India during partition) Chaudhuri argued for ensuring citizenship rights for people who have migrated to Assam long before the partition. Chaudhuri pointed out that Draft Article 11 (Article 17 of the Constitution of India, 1950) which prohibits untouchability was vague as it did not define untouchability. Through his amendment, he sought to clarify the meaning and scope of untouchability. When the Assembly was debating Draft Article 9 (Article 15 of the Constitution of India) which prohibits discrimination, Chaudhuri argued for including dress based non-discrimination.
