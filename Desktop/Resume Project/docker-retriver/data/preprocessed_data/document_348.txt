Summary Draft Article 51 was debated in Constituent Assembly on 28 December 1948. It lays down the procedure and conditions through which a vacancy in the office of President is filled. There were only two objections to the Article. The first was related to the second part of Clause 2 that set out the newly elected President’s term: a newly elected President would serve a term of 5 years irrespective of how long the old president served in office. This would lead to the parliament’s and the President’s terms to not run in parallel. This bothered a member who felt that the two terms must run in parallel to avoid the President influencing elections to the Parliament. Another member said that the Draft Article made inadequate arrangements for the interim period that lay between the removal/death/resignation of a President and the installation of a new President. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded to these concerns. He first argued that there was no reason why a newly elected President must serve a term less than five years. Second, he said that the interim period between the old and the new President was taken care of by Draft Article 54. The Draft Article was adopted without amendment.
