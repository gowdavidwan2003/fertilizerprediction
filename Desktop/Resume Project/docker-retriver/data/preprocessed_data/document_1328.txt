Indian Independence Act 1947 (UK Parliament) Archives - Constitution of India Home ≫ Historical Constitutions ≫ Indian Independence Act 1947 (UK Parliament) HISTORICAL CONSTITUTIONS Indian Independence Act 1947 (UK Parliament) Remarks The Indian Independence Act 1947 was legislation passed by the British Parliament that legally set up the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan. The Act codified British withdrawal from and the partition of India. In 1950, the Constitution of India came into effect and India transformed from an independent dominion to an independent constitutional republic. On 20 February 1947, the British, through its Prime Minister Clement Atlee made it clear that they would leave India. The two major political parties at the time the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League welcomed the move. However, the Congress wanted the British to leave behind one independent entity – India, and the League wanted two: India and Pakistan. The British government sent Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy, to India to resolve the political crisis to facilitate British withdrawal. It was decided that the partition question would be put to the Provincial Legislative Assemblies of Bengal, Punjab and Sindh. These Assemblies decided that their Muslim majority areas be partitioned. In light of this, the British decided to leave behind a partitioned India and this was done through the Indian Independence Act 1947. The Act was written in a legal style, was 22 pages long and organised around 20 sections and three schedules. It set 15 August 1947 as the date when the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan would come into effect. It partitioned the provinces of Bengal, Punjab and Sindh, made necessary changes to Government of India Act 1935, transferred legislative authority to the Constituent Assemblies of India and Pakistan. The Act was a watershed movement for the Indian Freedom Movement and marks the culmination of decades of struggle for independence and remains an inflection point in Indian history. It laid to rest the question of Pakistan that had animated the Indian political landscape for nearly a decade. Importantly, while the Act did substantively cut the link between India and Britain, India was still a dominion under the Governor-General who was the representative of the British Crown. Also, Constituent Assembly members were not happy with the fact that India’s independence could be traced to the Act. So they did two things: first, the Assembly did not put the final Constitution it drafted to British parliament to approve as was provided for in the Act. Second, it repealed the Act itself through Article 395 of the Constitution. It is after the Constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950, that India severed all links with Britain. IIA An Act to make provision for the setting up in India of two independent Dominions, to substitute other provisions for certain provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, which apply outside those Dominions, and to provide for, other matters consequential on or connected with the setting up of those Dominions.
