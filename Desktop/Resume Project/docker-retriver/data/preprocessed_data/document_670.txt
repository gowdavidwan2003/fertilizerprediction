Summary Draft Article 302 (Article 361 of the Constitution of India, 1950) was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 8 September 1949. The Draft Article barred courts of law from questioning any action taken by the President of India or Governor(s) of a State. While in office, the President and Governors cannot be charged with a crime, arrested or imprisoned. A civil case, however, can be filed against them. The Draft Article clarified that citizens’ right to sue the Union or State Government(s) remained unaffected. The Drafting Committee Chairman introduced some amendments. One of them aimed to more comprehensively and unequivocally signal that nothing in the Draft Article took away a person’s right to sue the Union or State government(s). A Drafting Committee colleague emphasised that this amendment aimed to protect citizens’ fundamental rights. One Member found the phrase ‘during his term of office’ ambiguous. He said that it could mean two things: While in office, the President and Governor were not liable for any criminal act they commit, or that the President or Governor had to resign as soon as they were charged with committing a crime. Which of these did the Draft Article imply? — the Member asked the Drafting Committee. Despite the Member’s requests, the question remained unaddressed. There was no other significant discussion. On 8 September 1949 the Assembly adopted Draft Article 302 with the amendments suggested by the Draft Committee Chairman.
