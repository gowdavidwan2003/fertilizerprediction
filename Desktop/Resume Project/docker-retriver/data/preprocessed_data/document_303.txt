Summary Draft Article 23(1)-(2) (Article 29) were debated on 7 and 8 December 1948. It aimed to secure the cultural and educational rights of minorities. One member proposed to amend clause (1) to give minorities the right to ‘develop’ their culture. He argued that culture was not static; it was dynamic and progressive, and the Draft Article should reflect the same. This was rejected by the Assembly. Another member wanted to limit the scope of the Draft Article only to linguistic minorities. He argued that recognizing special rights for religious minorities would promote communalism. This was in contrast to a proposal to expand the Draft Article to cover religious, racial, caste, and linguistic minorities. The second proposal was accepted by the Assembly, and the Draft Article was adopted on 8 December 1948.
