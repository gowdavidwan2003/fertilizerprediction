Summary Draft Article 158 (Article 179) was debated on 2 June 1949. It regulated the vacation, resignation or removal of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of a State Legislative Assembly. A member proposed an amendment to clause (c) so that the Speaker and Deputy Speaker could be removed by a resolution passed by ‘the members of the Assembly present and voting‘. He argued that only the opinion of those members present in the House on the day the resolution is proposed should be taken into account. This amendment was negatived without debate. Draft Article 158 was adopted on 2nd June 1949.
