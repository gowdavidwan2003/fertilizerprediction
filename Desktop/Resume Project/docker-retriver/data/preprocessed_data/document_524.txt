Summary Draft Article 181 (Article 206) was debated on 10 June 1949. It set out the procedure for making a demand for an excess grant requiring a vote of the Legislative Assembly. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to wholly replace the Draft Article, to explicitly grant the Legislative Assembly of a state certain powers with respect to votes on account, votes on credit, and exceptional grants, including the power to withdraw money for these grants from the Consolidated Fund of the state. It was accepted without any debate. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 10 June 1949.
