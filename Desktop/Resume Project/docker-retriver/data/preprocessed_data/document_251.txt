Summary Draft Article 142 (Article 162) was debated on 1st June 1949. It defined the scope of the executive power of each State. A member of the Drafting Committee proposed an amendment to wholly replace the Draft Article with the following: ‘Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of each State shall extend to the matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws.‘ He contended that this would simplify the wording of the Draft Article. Moreover, it reduced complications as the current Draft Article referred to States in Part III of the First Schedule, and the Assembly had not yet defined their position. The amendment was accepted without debate. Draft Article 142 was adopted by the Assembly on 1st June 1949.
