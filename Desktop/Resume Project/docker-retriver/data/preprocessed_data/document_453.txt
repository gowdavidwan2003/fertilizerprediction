Summary Draft Article 285 (Article 316, Constitution of India 1950) was debated on 22 August 1949. The Draft Article regulated the appointment and composition of the members of the Public Service Commission. The Drafting Committee Chairman moved an amendment to split the Draft Article and divide them into individual articles. The amended Draft Article 285 provided for the appointment and term of the office members of a Public Service Commission. A Member felt that only civil servants were advantaged by the provision which stated that half of the members of the commission must have held office for at least 10 years under a state government or the Union Government. The Chairman responded by saying that the provision was not to benefit civil servants and that it was necessary for those with experience to be on the Commission. An amendment was moved to changed the requirement to ‘as nearly as may be one-half’ of the members. The Assembly passed this amendment and it was adopted into the Article. The amended Draft Article was added to the Constitution on the same day.
