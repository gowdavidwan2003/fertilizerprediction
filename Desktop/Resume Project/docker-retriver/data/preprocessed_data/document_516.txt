Summary Draft Article 197 (Article 221) was debated on 1 August 1949. It prescribed the salaries, rights and allowances for Judges of the High Courts. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed to wholly replace the Draft Article with the following: (1) There shall be paid to the Judges of each High Court such salaries as are specified in the Second Schedule (2) Every Judge shall be entitled to such allowances and to such rights in respect of leave of absence and pensions as may from time to time be determined by or under law made by Parliament, and until so determined, to such allowances and rights as are specified in the Second Schedule: Provided that neither the allowances of a Judge nor his rights in respect of leave of absence or pension shall be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment. He explained that this would allow the Article to correspond with Draft Article 104 (Article 125), which laid down salaries, rights and allowances for Judges of the Supreme Court. The amendment was adopted without debate Draft Article 197 was adopted on 1 August 1949.
