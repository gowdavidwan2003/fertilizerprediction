Summary Draft Article 82 (Article 101) was discussed on 19 May 1949. It laid down circumstances under which a member’s seat would be considered vacant. The original Draft Article did not include clause 2. It was inserted through an amendment moved by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee. A member sought to add recollection of a member of the Parliament by electors as a ground for a vacation of his/her seat. He invoked the Swiss and American examples to illustrate how several democratic countries provide for the right to recall a member of the Parliament if he/she fails to ‘discharge their duties to the constituency’. He argued that under ‘ideal conditions of democracy’, the right to recall must find a place. One member was not convinced by this proposal. He argued that the amendment did not spell out practical aspects of the recall process. Moreover, it would cause practical hurdles. Another member wanted to make it a mandatory for a member to be able to read and write the National Language to be elected to the Parliament. This would popularise and encourage people to speak the National Language. The Assembly did not accept any of these proposals. It adopted the Draft Article with minor amendments.
