Summary Draft Article 205 (Article 229) was debated on 8 June 1949. It laid out provisions to regulate the salaries, allowances and pension of officers and servants of the Court. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed to wholly substitute the Draft Article, to bring it in line with the provisions for officers and servants of the Supreme Court. The amendment required the Chief Justice to fix salaries in consultation with the Governor. The Chairman further proposed that rules relating to emoluments should only be decided by the Governor of the concerned state. The debates on the Draft Article were based on these amendments. Some members argued that the Governor should not be involved in determining the emoluments of the officers and servants of the High Court, as it would compromise the independence of the judiciary. Despite these objections, the Assembly accepted both amendments. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 8 June 1949.
