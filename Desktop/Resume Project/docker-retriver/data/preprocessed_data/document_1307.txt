Indian Councils Act, 1909 Archives - Constitution of India Home ≫ Historical Constitutions ≫ Indian Councils Act, 1909 HISTORICAL CONSTITUTIONS Indian Councils Act, 1909 Remarks The Indian Councils Act 1909 was introduced by the British government in India as a step towards including Indians in government. It is also referred to as the Morley-Minto reforms named after the two British officials who played a key role in its drafting: Lord Minto and Lord John Morley, who were the Viceroy and Secretary of State of British India respectively in 1905-10. In the early 20th century, two developments emerged in the Indian national movement: first, nationalists became increasingly vocal and adopted a stronger tone while demanding representation of Indians in government. Second, the period saw the emergence of extremist nationalists who aimed to undermine the foundations of the British rule; In some cases, government officials – both British and Indian – were killed. The British termed the prevailing political situation in the country as the ‘Indian Unrest’. Lord Minto denounced the extremists but felt it was imperative to engage with the moderates and provide some political concessions – which came to be packaged as the Morley-Minto reforms. These reforms were the basis of the Indian Councils Act 1909. The Act was a relatively short document, consisted of eight articles and two schedules, and was written in a legal style. Its core feature was the recognition of the principle of elections of members to the central and provincial legislative councils. The Articles of the Act, among other things, did the following: increased the size of various provincial legislative councils, created executive councils in the provinces of Bombay, Madras and West-Bengal, and introduced the office of a ‘Vice-President’ at both at the centre and the provinces. The Act itself was skeletal; it was operationalized by a set of rules and regulations that fleshed out details that included: the extent of (limited) franchise, qualifications for members of legislative councils and strikingly, the introduction of separate electorates for Muslims. While Indian nationalists welcomed the Act – as it seemed to provide the opportunity for Indian to join the government – they were not happy with the rules and regulations that spelt out the details especially the introduction of separate electorates on the basis of religion which they viewed as divisive. Other aspects of the Act that disappointed the Indian nationalists was limited franchise and unreasonable qualifications required to stand for elections. The nationalists, not completely satisfied, continued their battle for substantive forms of self-government after the Act was put in place. R. Coupland in The Constitutional Problem of India (1944) argues that while the Act could be seen as introducing representative government – British state officials did not think so and underplayed this. They still considered legislative councils as ‘durbars rather than parliaments’ and felt that Indians were not ready for self-government. Lord Morley himself told the House of Lords: ‘ if it could be said that this chapter of reforms led directly or necessarily to the establishment of a parliamentary system in India, I for one, would have nothing at all to do with it’.
