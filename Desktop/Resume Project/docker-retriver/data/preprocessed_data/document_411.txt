SUMMARY Draft Article 256 (Article 276, Constitution of India 1950) was debated on 9 August 1949. It empowered the State Legislatures to make laws on specific subjects. It also stated that this power given to the State legislature under the Draft Article did not limit Parliament’s taxation powers. This Draft Article prescribed an upper limit for the amount payable by a person to the State or any other local authority. A member proposed that the upper limit for the total amount payable by one person to the State or other authority should be changed to ‘one percent of their annual income‘ or ‘one thousand rupees‘. This, he claimed, would be a source of income for local bodies who practically had no finances. Further, it would allow the rich to be taxed higher and would reduce the burden on the poor. This amendment was opposed by multiple members. One Member contended that the amendment would mean that tax could be collected from a person’s income which would be an encroachment on the Centre’s taxation powers and source of revenue (income tax). The Chairman of the Drafting Committee also turned down the amendment and argued that the Draft Article was only an exception to the larger principle that the Constitution would not make any mention of how financial resources would be allocated to the local bodies – this would be decided by the States. The Amendment was finally rejected and Draft Article 256 was adopted to the Constitution on 9 August 1949.
