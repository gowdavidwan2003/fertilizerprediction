Summary Draft Article 62 (Article 75) was debated on 30 and 31 December 1948, and on 14 and 17 October 1949. This article sought to govern the office of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. Importantly, it established the collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the House of People. A member wanted to introduce a new provision to regulate the removal of Ministers. He argued that encoding this would prevent misuse of power by the future legislature on the Ministers. This would ensure non-interference and smooth administration of the responsibilities of the Ministers. There was a proposal to ensure that the Prime Minister would be appointed from a political party with the majority votes in the Parliament. This would enable a stable Ministry that ‘commands confidence in the House’. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment that would mandate the President to follow the Instrument of Instructions to exercise his/her power. It also barred the scrutiny of decisions taken by the President. Another member was against such bar, he argued that this would give rise to an ‘autocratic President’ as opposed to a ‘constitutional President’. A member sought to replace ‘pleasure of the President’ with ‘confidence of the House of People’. He highlighted that this proposal was not motivated by communalism, instead, it merely codified an existing convention. He argued that as a matter of practice, the Ministers held their position only as long as they commanded the confidence of the House of People. This convention which found its practice in Britain and America needed to be written in the Constitution and not left out for future ambiguities or Supreme Court interpretation. In order to be appointed as a Minister, one member proposed, he/she should have been elected from the House of People. He pointed out that the appointing ‘permanent Ministers’ from the nominated members of the Parliament would violate democratic principles. Only a member who had the confidence of the electorate must be made a Minister. Only the proposal of the Drafting Committee Chairman was accepted. The Assembly adopted the Draft Article on 31 December 1948. However, the Drafting Committee moved to delete their earlier amendment on 14 October 1949.
