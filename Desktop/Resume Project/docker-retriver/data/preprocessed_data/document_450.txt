Summary Draft Article 283 (Article 313, Constitution of India 1950) was discussed on 8 September 1949. The Article was purely transitional in nature and stated that all the rules in force right before the commencement of the Constitution will continue to apply to any public service or post even after the Constitution was enacted. The Drafting Committee Chairman moved an amendment to substitute the Draft Article with another one which had a few semantic changes. The substance and meaning of the Article remained the same. The Amendment was adopted without any discussion and the Draft Article was added to the Constitution on the same day.
