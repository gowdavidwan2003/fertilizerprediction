Summary Draft Article 87 (Article 107) was debated on 20 May 1949. It regulated the introduction and passing of Bills. A member proposed to provide for the Parliament to receive petitions and representations from the people. People should have the right to represent directly to the legislature on any financial or administrative matters. This would be crucial in testing popular opinion. Another member was opposed to the House of Councils being treated at par with the House of People. He argued that the House of People represented the democratic will and should be given a superior position to that of the House of Councils, a merely advisory body meant to check on ‘hasty legislation’. The Assembly did not accept any amendments. It adopted the Draft Article on 20 May 1949.
