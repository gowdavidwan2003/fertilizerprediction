Summary Draft Article 90 (Article 110) was debated on 20 May 1949 and 8 June 1949. It laid down the definition and scope of Money Bills. The first iteration of the Draft Article was discussed on 20th May 1949. A member moved an amendment to insert ‘duty, charge, rate, levy or any other form of revenue, income or receipt by’ in clause 1 (a). He was concerned that the word ‘tax’ may be too narrowly construed by lawyers. The other forms of income or public revenue would, therefore, be excluded. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee noted that the Committee would reconsider this provision and present it at a later stage. On 8th June 1949, he moved a series of amendments. He sought to replace clauses 1 (c) and (d) with the following: ‘(c) the custody of the Consolidated Fund or the Contingency Fund of India, the payment of moneys into or the withdrawal of moneys from any such fund; (d) the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India’ Through his amendment, the Chairman introduced the Assembly to the Consolidated Fund of India. He noted that the Consolidated Fund was just another term for Public Account (revenues) of the Central Government. Citing references to the Constitutions of Canada, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, he argued that Consolidated Fund was a necessity – it would prevent ‘proceeds of taxes being frittered away by laws made by Parliament in individual purposes without regard to the general necessity of the people at all.’ A member was apprehensive about the change in nomenclature. He was not convinced as to way ‘revenues of India’ needed to be changed to ‘Consolidated Fund of India’. He believed that the latter term could create confusion as it indicated the existence of a fund other than revenues of India. Another member, although noted that use of ‘Consolidated Fund’ would clarify the procedural aspects of the Money Bill, it ‘burden(ed) the Constitution too much with details’. The Assembly accepted the amendments moved by the Drafting Committee and adopted the Draft Article on 8 June 1949.
