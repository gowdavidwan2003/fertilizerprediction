SUMMARY Draft Article 263 was discussed over three days- 10 August 1949, 9 September 1949 and 13 October, 1949. It requires the custody, payment and withdrawal of money received as revenue from the State or Union public accounts to be regulated by law. On 10 August, the Chairman of the Drafting committee proposed that the the words ‘Consolidated Fund’ be substituted in place of ‘revenues of India’ in the Draft Article and also made a few technical changes to the text. The new article read as: “Custody of Consolidated Funds, the payment of moneys in to and withdrawal of moneys from such funds. (1) The custody of the Consolidated Fund of India, the payments of moneys into such Fund, the withdrawal of moneys there from and all other matters connected with or ancillary to the matters aforesaid shall be regulated by law made by Parliament, and until provision in that behalf is so made by Parliament, shall be regulated by rules made by the President. (2) The custody of the Consolidated Fund of a State, the payments of moneys into such Fund and the withdrawal of moneys therefrom, and all other matters connected with or ancillary to the matters aforesaid shall be regulated by law made by the Legislature of the State, and, until provision in that behalf is so made by the Legislature of the State, shall be regulated by rules made by the Governor of the State.” The amendment as well as the Draft Article was adopted without any substantial discussion. There were a few changes made to the adopted Article on 9 September 1949 and 13 October 1949, both of which were adopted without any debates or discussion.
