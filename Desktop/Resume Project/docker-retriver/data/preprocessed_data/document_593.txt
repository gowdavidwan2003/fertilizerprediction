Summary Draft Constitution 88 (Article 108) was discussed on 20 May 1949. It laid down procedure for convening a joint sitting of the Parliament. A member proposed an amendment to delete ‘for the purposes of the Constitution’ under clause 4. He argued that this phrase was ‘redundant, needless and superfluous’. Another member was not convinced of the existence of this Draft Article. He disagreed with the position of the House of Councils in the Indian Constitution. He believed that the House of Councils was given disproportionate authority. Comparing to the House of Lord in the United Kingdom, he argued for the power and role of the House of Councils to be highly restricted. The Draft Article by allowing joint sessions was giving the Upper House undue importance and authority. One member was quick to jump in and defend the Draft Article and the role of the House of Councils in Indian parliamentary framework. He noted that unlike the House of Lord, which is hereditary, the House of Councils represented the elected voices of the States. And it was unique to the Indian federal set up. In situations of legislative deadlock, this Draft Article offered a solution. The Assembly adopted the Draft Article with few minor amendments on 20 May 1949.
