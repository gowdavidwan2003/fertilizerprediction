ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE 10.145.1 President Honourable Members are aware that they have been discussing a very important question in their other capacity in the adjoining room and it has been suggested to me that we might adjourn today to enable the discussion of that question to be completed by this evening. I have said that personally I would have no objection if the Members of the House have no objection. I would therefore like to know if honourable Members have any objection to this. 10.145.2 We have no objection. 10.145.3 President Then we shall adjourn. The next question is, at what time do we meetMEETING TIME FOR THE HOUSE 10.145.4 At 10 o’clock. 10.145.5 At 9 o’clock. 10.145.6 Seth Govind Das Let us meet from Nine to one. 10.145.7 President I do not see which opinion is stronger, but I can see that opinion is divided. 10.145.8 M. Thirumala Rao Without consulting the House this meeting was summoned at 11 o’clock today. Let it stand for tomorrow also. 10.145.9 President In the Rules it is provided that normally the Assembly will begin at 11 o’clock. I have summoned it at 11 o’clock in accordance with the rules. 10.145.10 M. Thirumala Rao Then why consult the House now ? 10.145.11 President I am consulting it about the adjournment. We adjourn now. From tomorrow it is open to fix any time. But I shall be glad to consult the convenience of Members. 10.145.12 R. K. Sidhwa Let us have it from 9-30 to 1-30. 10.145.13 President That is a compromise between 9 and 10. 10.145.14 Rohini Kumar Chaudhuri Let it be from 9 to 12-30 or 1 P.M. because at 1-30 one feels terribly hungry. 10.145.15 Hriday Nath Kunzru I suggest you should have it from 10 to 1 or from 9 to 1, if you want to have four hours, but not from 9-30 to 1- 30. 10.145.16 Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar 10 o’clock would be all right. I suggest 10 o’clock as a compromise, and for this reason. We from Madras are generally accustomed to take our meals by 10 o’clock; we do not take lunch and all that kind of thing. Therefore it will be much better to have it at 10 o’clock-because 11 will be too late. 10.145.17 B. R. Ambedkar I think, Sir. that 10 to 1 will be all right. 10.145.18 President It all depends upon the quantity of work we have to get through. 10.145.19 K. M. Munshi Sometimes we may have to meet twice a day. 10.145.20 President I do not object to that. We will adjust the timings according to the quantity of work we have to get through. 10.145.21 Biswanath Das 9 to 1 is not acceptable to us. I would suggest 3 to 7 p.m. 10.145.22 R. K. Sidhwa We must have two sessions later on. 10.145.23 Let it be from 9 to 1. 10.145.24 President I would suggest one thing, if the Members do not mind. I would suggest that to begin with we start at 10 o’clock tomorrow and then we see what progress we are making. If we find that we are able to complete the work with three hours every day then we can continue from10 to 1. If on the other hand we find that the progress is not satisfactory then we shall think of changing the timings. If this finds approval we shall begin at 10 o’clock tomorrow. 10.145.25 That is agreeable. 10.145.26 President The House stands adjourned till 10 of the Clock tomorrow. The Assembly adjourned till Ten of the Clock on Friday, the 7th October, 1949. Next 07 Oct 1949 | Volume 10
