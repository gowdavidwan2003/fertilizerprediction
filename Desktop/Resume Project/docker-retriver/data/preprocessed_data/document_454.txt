Summary Draft Article 285A (Article 317 of Constitution of India 1950) was not included in the Draft Constitution 1948. It was introduced by the Drafting Committee Chairman on 22 August 1949. It laid down the manner in which a member of a Public Service Commission may be suspended or removed. The President was empowered to remove a member of a Public Service Commission in two instances – (i) proof of misbehaviour and (ii) automatic disqualification. The grounds for automatic disqualification were (i) being declared insolvent, (ii) infirmity of mind or body or (ii) taking up any other employment during the period of membership with the Public Service Commission. A Member felt that the phrase ‘shall only be removed’ should be replaced with ‘may be removed’. The Assembly did not discuss this suggestion. Another Member proposed that the phrase ‘misbehaviour or of infirmity of mind or body’, be substituted with the words ‘misdemeanour or incapacity’ as the phrase was colloquial. The Assembly rejected this amendment without any debate. The Draft Article was adopted on the same day.
