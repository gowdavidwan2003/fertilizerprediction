Summary Draft Article 302AAA (Article 364 of the Constitution of India, 1950) was absent in the Draft Constitution of India 1948. On 17 October 1949, a Drafting Committee Member introduced it as an amendment in the Assembly. The Draft Article gave the President the power to publicly notify that a Union or State law(s) will not apply to a major port or aerodrome. Alternatively, the President could also decide how a Union or State law should be applied to these facilities. The Drafting Committee member told the Assembly that ports and aerodromes are special public spaces as they receive international passengers and have unique security requirements. Situations may arise where State and Union laws might not be sufficient or appropriate to ensure smooth administration. The Draft Article aimed to give the President legislative and executive power to deal with such situations. A Member argued that since Parliament alone (and not the State legislatures) had the power to make laws for ports and aerodromes under the Draft Constitution, there was no need to give the President such powers. The Drafting Committee Chairman corrected the Member and said that the Union legislature had only limited powers, the rest lay with the State legislatures where the port or aerodrome was located. Therefore, the Draft Article was necessary. There was no further discussion and Draft Article 302AA was adopted on 17 October 1949.
