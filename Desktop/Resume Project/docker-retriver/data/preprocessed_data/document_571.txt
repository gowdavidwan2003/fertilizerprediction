Summary Draft Article 77 (Article 94) was debated on 19 May 1949. It regulated vacation, resignation or removal of Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the House of the People. A member moved an amendment that would require the Speaker to submit his/her resignation to the President instead of the Deputy Speaker. He argued that in the interest of ‘decorum’ and ‘proprieties’ resignation must not be submitted to a subordinate officer. In opposition, a member noted that the President was the Executive head and he/she should not interfere with the Legislature. The arrangement in the Draft Article ensured the independence of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee clarified the principle behind the Draft Article. He said that resignation should be submitted to the appointing authority. In the case of Speaker and Deputy Speaker, the House of the People was the appointing authority, not the President. Since the House was a ‘collective body’ resignation need not be given to each member. It would be appropriate to submit it to the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker. After the Chairman’s clarifications, the mover of the amendment withdrew it. The Assembly adopted the Draft Article on 19 May 1949.
