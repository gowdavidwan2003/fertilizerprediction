Summary Draft Article 59 was debated on 29th December 1948 and 17th October 1949. It dealt with the President’s pardoning power. A member proposed to delete clause 3 of the Draft Article. He argued that as the ‘Supreme Head of the State’ only the President must have the power to decide on clemency pleas. He invoked American and English examples to demonstrate how pardoning power is usually restricted to the representative of a nation. If the Governor or Ruler of the Indian States also shared this power, it would impinge on India’s federalism and sovereignty. In response, a member argued against the proposal. He noted how the Governor would be best placed to decide on pardoning cases as he/she would be ‘better informed’. He also pointed out that as an appointee of the Prime Minister, the Governor was responsible to the legislature. This would keep a check on his/her exercise of the pardoning power. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee clarified the general principles of this Draft Article. The pardoning power for offences committed against Federal laws would be with the President and for those committed against State laws would be with the Governor. However, with respect to the death penalty, both would have clemency power. The Chairman, responding to the proposal to remove clause 3, pointed out that the Draft Article put in place the existing practice. The Governor on Home Minister’s advice would decide on the pardoning pleas first. Only the rejected pleas would then go to the President. The Assembly adopted the Draft Article without any amendments on 29th December 1948. The Draft Article was reopened for discussion on 17th October 1949 and adopted with a minor amendment.
