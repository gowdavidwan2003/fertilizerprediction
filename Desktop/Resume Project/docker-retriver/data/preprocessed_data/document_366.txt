Summary Draft Article 67 (1) to (4) (Article 80) was debated on 3 January and 17 October 1949. It laid down the composition of the Council of States. A member moved an amendment to delete clause 2. He believed that members to the Parliament must only be elected, not nominated. Nominations adversely affect the ‘internal symmetry of the Legislative bodies’. Moreover, the categories of interests from where persons could be nominated were ‘not quite consistent intrinsically, logical or scientific’. Another member argued that indirect election or nomination should not find a place in the Constitution. If the intention behind clause 2 was to rope in talented and intelligent persons to the Councils, this could be achieved through regular elections as well. Alternatively, the House could set up a board of advisors with meritorious members to aid legislative business. There was another proposal to constitute a ‘Consultative Council’ with representatives from various sectors including agriculture, industry, commerce etc. This Council would not have any administrative or executive powers. It would be entrusted with the responsibility of examining legislative proposals before being taken up by the Parliament. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee found this proposal to be unnecessary. He argued that as a matter of policy, the Government anyway consulted experts before introducing any law in the Parliament. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to decrease the nominated members from 15 to 12. This was accepted, along with certain other amendments moved by the Drafting Committee, and the Draft Article was adopted on 4 January 1949. The Assembly accepted a few more amendments on 17 October 1949.
