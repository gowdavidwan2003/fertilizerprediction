Summary Draft Article 135 (Article 158) was debated on 31st May 1949 and 14th October 1949. It laid out the conditions of service for a Governor. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved that clause (1) be amended to prevent a member of ‘either House of Parliament or of a House’ of any State Legislature from being appointed as a Governor. The Chairman also proposed the amendment of clause (2) to read ‘The Governor shall not hold any other office of profit’. Both were accepted by the Assembly. Another member of the House proposed that the requirement for the Governor to have an official residence be deleted. He argued that it was unnecessary to mention such a minor detail in the Constitution, and that other Constitutions did not include similar provisions. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded that this was analogous to Draft Article 48 (Article 59) which set out the official residence of the President. This amendment was negatived. The amended Draft Article was initially adopted on 31st May 1949. Subsequently, a member of the Drafting Committee proposed to amend clause (3) to explicitly entitle a Governor to rent-free use of his official residence. He contended that this was necessary in light of a similar amendment to Draft Article 48 relating to the President’s official residence. The same member also proposed that the Draft Article be amended to permit Parliament to determine the emoluments and allowances payable to a Governor, rather than the concerned State Legislature. He argued that this was necessary since a Governor would be appointed by the President, and therefore it was improper for a State Legislature to deliberate on the matter. Both amendments were accepted without much opposition on 14th October 1949.
