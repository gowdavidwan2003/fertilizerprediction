SUMMARY Draft Articles 234 and 234A (Article 257) was debated on 13 June 1949 and 9 September 1949. It gave the Union certain power over the states. The Drafting Committee Chairman proposed the insertion a new clause and an amendment, respectively. The clause stated that the Centre had to compensate the states for any additional costs undertaken under its direction. This was added without any objection. The amendment (Article 234A) was about the railways. It gave the Centre the power to direct the state to increase policing in any railway that might require it. This was disputed by a member who asserted that the provision was not required since the Centre already had enough power. The Chairman clarified that it was needed since ‘police’ was not a Union subject, and that ‘Railway Police’ is a subject within the authority of the State. Additionally, he cleared that the railways were given focus since people gathered there in masses. Draft Article 234 was initially adopted without debate on 13 June 1949. Subsequently, the addition (234A) to the Draft Article was adopted on 9 September 1949.
