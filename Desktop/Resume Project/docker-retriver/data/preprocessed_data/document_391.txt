SUMMARY Draft Article 231 (Article 254) was discussed on 13 June 1949. The Draft Article states what should be done if there is conflict or inconsistency between a State law and a Parliament law mentioned in the Concurrent List. When there is an inconsistency the Union law will override State law. There was no discussion on this Draft Article. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to add the words ‘or Part III’ after the words ‘Part I’ in the Draft Article. This amendment added other Indian states under the ambit of the Draft Article. This was done so that the Draft Article would apply to both Governor’s Provinces (Part I States) and other princely states (Part III States) uniformly. This amendment was adopted without any debate. The Draft Article was adopted on 13 June 1949. Subsequently, the Article was also amended by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956.
