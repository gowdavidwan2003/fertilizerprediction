Summary Draft Article 19 (Article 25) was debated on 3 and 6 December 1948. It gave Indians the individual right to religious freedom subject to some restrictions. There debate revolved around two key questions: Would the right to propagate religion facilitate forced conversions? Should the social welfare and reform clause extend to Buddhists, Jains and Christians? Some members were concerned that the right to propagate would permit forced conversions. They proposed amendments to remove the right to propagate religion, or even to limit the right to practice religion to the private domain solely. This was opposed by other members who felt that there was nothing in the Draft Article that facilitated forced conversions. They added that the right to propagate religion would lead to public awareness about different religions and promote communal understanding and peace. The amendments were rejected by the Assembly. One Member wanted the scope of subclause (b) of clause (2) of the Draft Article to extend beyond Hindus to Buddhists, Jains and Christians. He argued that this would promote religious harmony among people following different belief systems. Although this amendment was initially rejected by the Assembly, the Drafting Committee later extended the clause to Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains. The Draft Article was adopted with minor amendments on 6 December 1948.
