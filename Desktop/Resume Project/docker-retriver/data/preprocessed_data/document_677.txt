Summary Draft Article 303(1) (Article 366 of the Constitution of India, 1950) was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 16 September, 17 September and 14 October 1949. Draft Article 303(1) was effectively a glossary to the Draft Constitution. It defined important terms like ‘Scheduled Caste’, ‘Scheduled Tribe’, ‘Anglo Indian’, ‘Agricultural Income’ and ‘Existing Law’. Members of the Drafting Committee introduced several amendments which were adopted by the Assembly without significant discussion. A Drafting Committee Member’s amendment to the definition of ‘Ruler’ triggered a minor discussion within the Assembly on who should be considered as the Ruler of a State. This question was important because the Constitution contained provisions related to the privileges (like privy purse) that only Rulers were entitled to. The Drafting Committee Member’s amendment allowed the President to recognize a Ruler and a successor to the Ruler. A Member suggested that a successor would automatically become the ruler and hence, did not have to be specifically recognized by the President. The Drafting Committee Member responded that it was necessary to specifically identify a successor to ensure that privileges were passed on from a Ruler to an appropriate successor. The Draft Article as amended in the Assembly was adopted into the Constitution on 17 September 1949.
