SUMMARY Draft Article 236 (Article 260, Constitution of India 1950) was first discussed on 13 June 1949 and 13 October 1949. There was no debate on 13 June 1949 and this Draft Article was held over. The Draft Article permitted the Government of India to undertake any executive, legislative and judicial functions in territories that, at the time, were not officially part of the Union of India. On 13 October 1949, the Drafting Committee Chairman proposed to replace the Draft Article with a more elegant and clear version. The proposed amendment was accepted without debate. The Draft Article, as amended was adopted on 13 October 1949.
