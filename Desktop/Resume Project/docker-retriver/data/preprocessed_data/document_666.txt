Summary Draft Article 213A (Article 241) was debated on 2 August 1949. It was not initially included in the Draft Constitution of India, 1948. Instead, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, introduced it as Draft Article 213A. The Chairman introduced this amendment because there was no constitutional recognition for High Courts for certain States. There was no substantive debate on this. Draft Article 213A was adopted on 2 August 1949. A member of the Drafting Committee introduced a second amendment to this Article on 16 October 1949 to substitute “for the purposes of this constitution” in clause (1) to “for all or any of the purposes of this constitution”. This amendment was subsequently adopted without much debate, on the 16 October 1949. Article 241 was further amended by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956.
