Summary Draft Article 17 (Article 23) was debated in the Assembly on 3rd December 1948. It prohibited human trafficking and forced labour. A member proposed that in addition to the specific mention of ‘begar’, the Article also make mention of ‘devadasi’ – the social practice of dedicating young women to temples which amounted to trafficking. In response, a member argued that this practice could be wiped out through ordinary legislation; moreover, public opinion had already mobilized against the practice. Further, he contended that the Draft Article was intended to apply only to social practices which had the support of vested interests. This amendment was therefore, rejected. One member wanted to provide for compensation for individuals performing compulsory service. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee argued that this was unnecessary since such service may not impact the ability of a person to earn their livelihood. The Draft Article was adopted with a minor amendment on the same day, that is 3 December 1948.
