SUMMARY Draft Article 278 was discussed in the Assembly on 3 August 1949 and 4 August 1949. It gave the President the authority to take over any or all executive powers of a State – popularly known as the ‘President’s rule’. The President can take such action based on the State Governor’s report that informs him/her that the State is not functioning according to the Constitution. The Draft Article also specifies details on how this power can be exercised. The Drafting Committee Chairman moved an amendment to effectively replace the Governor with the President as the first authority to declare, and initiate steps to resolve an emergency situation in a State. One member opposed the amendment stating that the side-lining of the Governor would first, undermine federalism and second, place too much burden on the President and Parliament. The amendment also wanted the President to issue a proclamation based on his or her own assessment even in the absence of a State Governor’s report. This triggered resistance from many members who argued that this dangerously expanded the President’s executive power. First, it would undermine State autonomy. Second, it would promote a dictatorial Union executive as was the case with the misuse of constitutional provisions by Hitler to establish dictatorship in Germany. Third, it replicated the powers of the Governor-General over the British India provinces as reflected in the Government of India Act 1935. The Chairman did find some support in the Assembly. One member argued that the President must be trusted to use powers under this Article. Instead he argued that, historically, the misuse of power was prevalent in the State executive. The Assembly adopted the Drafting Committee Chairman’s amendment and rejected the rest. The Draft Article was adopted with the amendments as a part of the Constitution on 4 August 1949.
