SUMMARY Draft Article 300 (Article 339, Constitution of India 1950) was taken up on 16 June, 1949. It gives the President the power to appoint a Commission to report on the administration and welfare of scheduled areas and tribes. The Drafting Committee Chairman moved an amendment to include Part III states of the first Schedule (Princely States) within the ambit of the Draft Article. Some members supported the Article and argued that it was important to include it in the Constitution for the empowerment of Scheduled Tribes. One Member however, felt that the Draft Article would not go far in imporving the conditions of Scheduled tribes. He stated that a mere appointment of a Commission wasn’t enough and felt that the Draft Article shouldn’t be added to the Constitution. The Drafting Committee Chairman’s amendment was accepted and the Draft Article was added to the Constitution without any further discussion.
