Summary Draft Article 284 (Article 315 Constitution of India 1950) was debated on 22 August 1949. It stated that Union and State Public Service Commissions would be constituted. Two or more States could have one common Public Service Commission. Further, on receiving a request from the Governor of a State, the Union Public Service Commission could also address the needs of a particular State. The Assembly President proposed to include the requirement for the State legislature to pass a resolution to set up a common Public Service Commission for two or more States. This joint public service commission would be set up by Parliament. Since the general principle was that each State should have its own Public Service Commission, any deviation from the same should be authorized by the respective legislatures. Some Members felt that the involvement of Parliament to set up a joint public service commission was unnecessary interference in provincial affairs. However, another Member believed that public services should be centralized and there must be no provision for distinct state public service officials. A Member also urged that the provisions on the Commissions should not be rigid and more discretion should be given to Parliament. He thought flexible provisions could help facilitate a more inclusive Commission. Others disagreed and stated that a comprehensive framework for these Commissions should be laid out in the Constitution to ensure its smooth functioning in the future. The assembly rejected these proposals and accepted the amendment put forward by the President. Draft Article 284 as amended was adopted on 22 August 1949.
