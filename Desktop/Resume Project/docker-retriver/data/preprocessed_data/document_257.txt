(1) The House or each House of the Legislature of a State shall have a secretarial staff of State Legislatures separate secretarial staff : Provided that nothing in this clause shall, in the case of the Legislature of a State having a Legislative Council, be construed as preventing the creation of posts common to both House of such Legislature.

One member proposed the insertion of a proviso clause (2) to allow the Governor to pass a rule which would require consultation with the Public Service Commission in order to appoint a person to the Secretariat who is not already attached to the State Legislature. He argued that the purpose of the Commission was to ensure that fairness was observed in making appointments, and therefore all appointments must be made on its recommendation. This was rejected without any debate. Draft Article 163A was adopted on 30th July 1949.
