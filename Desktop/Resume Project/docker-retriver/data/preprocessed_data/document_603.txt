Summary Draft Article 109 (Article 131) was debated on 3 June 1949 and 14 October 1949. It delineated the scope of original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. A member of the Drafting Committee proposed to delete clause (i) of the proviso. He argued for leaving any specific references to Part III of the Constitution out of the provision. There was an opposition to this provision principally. A member believed that in case of a dispute between states, the adjudicator should be the Government of India – not the Supreme Court. According to him, the states were subordinate to the Centre. The Assembly accepted the amendments of the Drafting Committee and adopted the Draft Article on 3 June 1949. The Draft Article was reopened for discussion on 14 October 1949 where both the clauses of the proviso were retained.
