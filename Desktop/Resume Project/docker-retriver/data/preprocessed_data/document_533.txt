Summary Draft Article 187 (Article 213) was debated on 14 June 1949. It defined the scope and limitations of the Governor’s power to pass ordinances. One member wanted to amend clause (2)(a) so that ordinances would expire in two weeks from the date of their promulgation, and to delete the Explanation to clause (2). In support of his proposals, he pointed out that an ordinance would stay in force for as long as the Legislature did not meet; since there could be more than six months between sessions, the present Draft Article could allow an ordinance to be in force for over seven months. As the ordinance was the result of executive powers, it should be subject to the scrutiny of the Legislature as soon as possible. Another member proposed a number of amendments, to the effect that the ordinance-making power should be confined to the President rather than Governors of individual states. He argued that this was an extraordinary power which should only be used after careful consideration and with the knowledge of the Centre. All the amendments were rejected without debate. Draft Article 187 was adopted on 14 June 1949.
