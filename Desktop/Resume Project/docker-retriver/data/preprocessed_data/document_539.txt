Summary Draft Article 152 (Article 173) was debated on 2nd June 1949. It set out the qualifications to become a member of a State Legislature. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to wholly replace the Draft Article so that the criteria for qualification was (1) citizenship of India; (2) at least 25 and 35 years of age for the Assembly and Council respectively; and (3) as prescribed by any law made by the State Legislature. This was accepted with one amendment. The subsequent debates in the Assembly were based on this amendment. One member wanted to reduce the minimum age to become a member of a Legislative Council, from thirty-five to thirty. to conform with the age requirement for members of the Upper House in the Parliament. This was accepted by the Assembly. Another member moved an amendment to further expand the list of qualifications to require candidates to be literate, and qualified to vote in the constituency from they seek election. He argued that illiteracy and ignorance were related, and so it would be dangerous for illiterate candidates to be elected to the Legislature. This was rejected by the Assembly. The amended Draft Article was adopted by the Assembly on 2nd June 1949.
