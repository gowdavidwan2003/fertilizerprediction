Summary Draft Article 5 (Article 5) laid down basic principles of citizenship. The Assembly discussed this Draft Article on 10, 11 and 12 August 1949. Some members sought to include a residuary provision for citizenship based on religion. They argued that every Hindu or Sikh who is not a citizen of any other state, irrespective of their residence should be entitled for Indian citizenship. In rebuttal, one member strongly urged against hyphenating religion and citizenship. He argued that rules must be informed by justice and equity and not on extraneous conditions. Another member was keen on the draft article accommodating dual citizenship. He added that this privilege must be extended to countries on the principle of reciprocity. One member believed that this Draft Article made Indian citizenship cheap and easily available. In response, it was pointed out that the provisions of this Draft Article were stricter than the American law on citizenship. Few members voluntarily withdrew their amendments, while other amendments which were put to vote were negatived. The Constituent Assembly adopted Draft Article 5 as introduced by the Drafting Committee on 12 August 1949.
