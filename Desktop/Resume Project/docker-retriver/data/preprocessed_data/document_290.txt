Summary Draft Article 276 was debated on 3 August 1949. Draft Article 276 empowered the Union Executive, during an emergency, to direct any State government’s executive powers. Further, it gave Parliament the power to make laws to expand the Union government’s executive powers. The Drafting Committee Chairman introduced an amendment to clarify that Parliament’s power to make laws to expand the Union Executive’s powers is not limited to the Constitution’s Union List subjects. A Member felt that this amendment was redundant since the Draft Article opened by stating that it would not be constrained by any other provision of the Constitution. Nonetheless, the Assembly adopted this amendment without any debate. The Drafting Committee Chairman proposed another minor amendment that did not change the substance of the Draft Article. The Assembly adopted this amendment as well. Draft Article 276 was adopted with amendments on 3 August 1949. In 1976, Article 353 was amended to extend the powers of the Union Parliament and Executive to exercise its powers under this provision to any State even if the proclamation of emergency is related to only one particular State or territory.
