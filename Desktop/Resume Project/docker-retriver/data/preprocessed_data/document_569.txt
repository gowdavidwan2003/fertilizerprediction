Summary Draft Article 75-A (Article 92) was debated on 19 May 1949. It was not a part of the initial Draft Constitution, 1948. The Drafting Committee introduced it as an amendment. It barred the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Council of State from presiding sittings dealing with any resolution seeking their removal. A member believed that the Draft Article failed to address a lacuna: while it prohibited the Chairman and Deputy Chairman from presiding a sitting that dealt with their removal, it did not provide for an alternative member to chair such sittings. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee justified the Draft Article. If the Chairman of the Council of States was facing removal charges then the Deputy Chairman would preside and vice versa. If Chairman or Deputy Chairman were absent or unavailable then the rules of procedure of the Council would apply and a member would be chosen to preside. The Constituent Assembly adopted the Draft Article, without any amendments, on 19 May 1949.
