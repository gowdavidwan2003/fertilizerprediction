SUMMARY Draft Article 278-A was discussed in the Assembly on 3 and 4 August 1949. When an emergency is proclaimed in a State, the President, under Draft Article 278, can declare that the State’s legislative powers will be exercised by the Union Parliament. Under Draft Article 278-A, Parliament can further delegate this power to the President or any other authority. The Draft Article also gives the President the exclusive power to take specific financial and legislative decisions for the State when the Union Parliament is not in session. All powers granted to the President and Parliament under this Draft Article shall be valid for a period of one year from the declaration of emergency. Some members were not convinced that Draft Article 278-A was necessary as the Union already had enough powers under other emergency provisions like Draft Article 275 and 276. The Drafting Committee Chairman disagreed, arguing that Draft Article 278-A was geared towards a specific type of emergency – those arising out of the failure of the constitutional machinery in a State. He emphasised that Draft Article 278-A was distinct from other emergency provisions. One member claimed that in a State emergency, the State Assembly must be given primacy. Otherwise, the Union Parliament and the Central Executive would risk becoming unpopular with the people of the State. A member responded by arguing that the level of responsible governance varied across the states and hence, needed checks from the centre to ensure a healthy functioning of the Constitution. Additionally, it was necessary for Parliament to delegate its power to the President to lessen Parliament’s burden. Another member added reassuringly that Parliament could always keep a check on the Power it delegates to the President. At the end of the debate, Draft Article 278-A was adopted by the Assembly on 4 August 1949.
