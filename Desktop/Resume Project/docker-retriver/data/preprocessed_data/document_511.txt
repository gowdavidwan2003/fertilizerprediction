Summary Draft Article 172 (Article 197) was debated on 1 August 1949. It placed some restrictions powers of the State Legislative Councils with respect to the passage of all Bills except Money Bills. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to wholly replace the Draft Article to allow the Legislative Assembly to prevail, in case of difference of opinion between the two Houses. The debates in the Assembly were based on this amendment. Some members voiced opposition to this, stating that the Legislative Council should have sufficient opportunities to discharge its functions; the time limits imposed by the current amendment would frustrate the ability of the Council to perform its duties. In response, a member pointed out that the purpose of the Council was to act as a check on the Assembly, and to ensure that legislation was not passed hastily; it was never intended to have equal powers. Other members argued that under clause (1) (b), the Council was given too short a time period to consider a Bill, before it would revert back to the Assembly to be passed. A member of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to increase the time limit in clause (1) (b) from two months to three. The Chairman responded that the prescribed time period had been adopted in order to ensure expediency in legislative matters; however, he accepted the proposed amendment. Both amendments were accepted by the Assembly. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 1 August 1949.
