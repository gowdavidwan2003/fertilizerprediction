Summary Draft Article 200 (Article 224) was debated on 7th June 1949. It provided for the appointment of additional and acting judges to the High Courts. A member proposed to amend the Draft Article so that the Chief Justice of a High Court had to obtain the consent of the President in order to appoint additional and acting judges. He argued that recalling a retired judge to the Bench amounted to a new appointment; since the President was the appointing authority for the judiciary, no judge should be called back to the Bench without his consent. In response, one member argued that the Chief Justice would be more familiar with the abilities of retired justices and that there was no reason to involve the President in the day-to-day administration of the Court. This amendment was adopted. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed a minor amendment to the language of the Draft Article. This was also adopted by the Assembly with little debate.
