Summary Draft Article 71 (Article 87) was discussed on 18 May 1949. It regulated the President’s special address to the Parliament. A member proposed an amendment that would make the subject of the President’s address broader. He argued that the President, being a non-party head of the state should provide ‘general issues of policy, or the prospects before the country, rather than with the specific causes of the summons’. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee pointed out that the phrase ‘causes of its summons’ was wide enough to include any subject matter. Hence it was unnecessary to accept this amendment. Another member was not convinced of the necessity of this Draft Article. He brought in a comparative perspective and noted that England did not make it binding on the King to address the Parliament. Having such compulsions on the President was not needed or useful. The Assembly adopted the Draft Article without any amendments on 18 May 1949.
