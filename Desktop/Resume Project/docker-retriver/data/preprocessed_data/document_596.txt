Summary Draft Article 103 (Article 124) was debated on 24 May 1949. It established the Supreme Court of India and also laid out provisions relating to the appointment, impeachment, and conduct of its judges. There was heated debate surrounding the consultation requirement in clause (2). One member proposed the removal of this requirement altogether, allowing the President to be solely responsible for the appointment of the Chief Just. Other members suggested amendments to the parties involved in the consultation or confirmation procedure. For instance, one member proposed that the appointment of any person to the position of Chief Justice had to be subject to confirmation of a two-thirds majority vote of a joint session of Parliament. This received some support in the Assembly, although it was countered that this would result in the Chief Justice being selected at the pleasure of the leader of the majority party. Another member proposed that the Council of States also be consulted by the President for the appointment of the Chief Justice. However, this was dismissed as importing the system of electing judges, rather than selecting them, given the political nature of the Council of States. A third member, citing a memo circulated by the Federal Court and Chief Justices of various High Courts, proposed that the appointment of the Chief of Justice of India should occur only with the concurrence of the sitting Chief Justice. His amendment was positively received by some members, one of whom supported its adoption, while the other further proposed that this requirement extends to the appointment of any judge in the High Court or Supreme Court. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded that the Draft Article sufficiently ensured the independence of the judiciary, as neither the executive nor the legislature had absolute authority in the matter. Other members objected to the age of retirement prescribed by the Draft Article. One member proposed that the retirement age be raised to sixty-eight years, citing the recommendations of the Federal Court on the matter. Another proposed that judges could ‘hold their office during good behaviour or until he resigns’. A third member who had qualms about the ability of older judges to keep up with the strenuous schedule imposed on members of the judiciary suggested that the age limit be reduced to sixty years. The President could then use his discretion to extend this to sixty-five years on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the fitness and ability of the individual judge. In response, a member suggested that the matter be left to Parliament, rather than constitutionally prescribing an arbitrary age limit, while another stated that although fixing a fair age limit was a difficult task, the existing limit was ‘by no means unfair, for it does not go beyond any reasonable age-limit’. Another source of contention in the Assembly was clause (7). One member proposed that judges should be debarred from holding any executive office after retirement, while another suggested that they be debarred from holding any office of profit. While a few other members agreed with these amendments, others contended that it was unfair to limit the activities of judges post-retirement. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee agreed with the latter view, especially in situations where only a retired judge would possess the experience and capability necessary to perform public service. An important amendment was moved by a member who sought to expand the list of persons who could be appointed to the courts. Citing the example of the International Court of Justice at the Hague, he proposed that clause (3) be amended to permit the President to appoint a ‘distinguished jurist’ to the courts. This was positively received by other members and the Chairman of the Drafting Committee. A number of amendments were negatived, while others were withdrawn. All of the amendments proposed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee were accepted by the Assembly. Two other amendments, to clause (2) and (3) respectively, were also accepted. The amended Draft Article was passed by the Assembly, and it was adopted on 24 May 1949.
