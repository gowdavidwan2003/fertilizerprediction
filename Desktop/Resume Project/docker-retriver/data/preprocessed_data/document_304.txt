Summary Draft Article 23A (Article 30) was debated on 8 December 1948. It allowed minorities to establish and administer their own educational institutions. This Draft Article was initially clause (3) of Draft Article 23. It was debated separately from Draft Articles 23(1)-(2) on the proposal of a member. One member proposed to give linguistic minorities the right to receive primary education in their own language and script. He invoked similar provisions in the Nehru Report of 1928 and a resolution by the Government in 1948. A member wanted to qualify this proposal by inserting ‘in case of substantial number of such students being available’. He pointed out that the constitutional right to freedom of movement meant that people from diverse linguistic backgrounds would settle across the country, and they should not be deprived of this right. Another member supported this second proposal, arguing that the first was economically unsound. However the Assembly rejected both proposals. The Draft Article was adopted without any amendments on 8 December 1948.
