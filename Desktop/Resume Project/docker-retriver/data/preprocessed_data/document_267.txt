Summary Article 4 (Draft Article 4) was discussed on 18 November 1948. It regulated laws made under Articles 2 and 3. There was no substantive debate on this Draft Article. One member, in the interest of brevity, sought to substitute ‘article 2 and article 3’ with ‘article 2 and 3’. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee opposed this. He noted that the Drafting Committee followed a common foreign precedent. Furthermore, the Government of India Act 1935 had also used this format. This amendment was subsequently rejected by the Constituent Assembly, and it adopted the Article on 18 November 1948.
