Summary Draft Article 146 (Article 166) was debated on 2 June 1949. It laid out the rules regulating the conduct of business of a State Government. A member proposed that clause (1) be amended so that the executive actions of the State Government would be expressed in the name of that Government. He argued that it was unusual and improper to attach so much importance to any individual especially in a democracy. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded that the language used in the current Draft Article was the ‘logical consequence’ of Draft Article 130 (Article 154) which stated that all executive power of a State vested in its Governor. The amendment was rejected by the Assembly. Draft Article 146 was adopted on 2 June 1949.
