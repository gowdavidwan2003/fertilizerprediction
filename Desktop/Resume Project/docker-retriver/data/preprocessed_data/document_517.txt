Summary Draft Article 175 (Article 200) was debated on 30 July, 1 August, and 17 October 1949. It regulated the Governor’s assent to Bills. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to substitute the proviso to Article 175 so that the Governor would have the ability to return a Bill for consideration in States with a bicameral legislature. One member argued that this was unnecessary because in such states, the Legislative Council could act as a safeguard. A member of the Drafting Committee responded that the amendment removed the discretionary power of the Governor to return a Bill. Instead he would do so only on the advice of the Council of Ministers, which limits the likelihood of the misuse of the provision. The amendment was accepted by the Assembly. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 1 August 1949. Subsequently, a member of the Drafting Committee proposed the insertion of a second proviso to mandate the Governor to reserve any Bill which would ‘derogate from the powers of the High Court’ for the consideration of the President. He stated that the Assembly had decided to delete the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, and therefore it was necessary to insert this proviso, whose substance had earlier been covered by the Schedule. The amendment was adopted by the Assembly on 17 October 1949.
