The Congress-League Scheme 1916 (INC & AIML) Archives - Constitution of India Home ≫ Historical Constitutions ≫ The Congress-League Scheme 1916 (INC & AIML) HISTORICAL CONSTITUTIONS The Congress-League Scheme 1916 (INC & AIML) Remarks The Congress-League Scheme 1916, also known as the Lucknow Pact, was a document jointly drafted by the Indian National Congress and the All India Muslim League. In 1913, the League at its Lucknow session – which Mohammad Ali Jinnah attended for the first time – decided to cooperate with the Congress and join in on calls for ‘self-government’. The Congress, in the same year, held its 28th session at Bombay. At this session, which Jinnah attended as a delegate, the Congress appreciated the League’s stance on self-government and laid the foundation for collaboration between the League and the Congress. Jinnah and Wazir Khan, the nationalist members of the League, ensured that the annual sessions of the Congress and the League happened at the same time and place (Bombay, 1915) and organised a joint meeting between both parties. At this meeting, both political organisations agreed to work together on a scheme that demanded self-government and put pressure on the British. They jointly appointed committees for this purpose; the committees met in Lucknow and Calcutta prepared a scheme of reforms. The Congress and the League endorsed these reforms at their respective annual sessions at Lucknow in 1916 – these reforms came to be known as the Congress-League Scheme 1916. The document was organised around seven parts; four dealt with the composition and functioning of the legislature and executive at the provincial and federal levels. The other three were titled: Secretary of State, India and the Empire, and Military and Other Matters. The document proposed separate electorates and proportional representation for minorities, especially Muslims, at the provincial and federal legislatures. Other notable aspects of the document included: calls for equality with other British dominions, the abolishing of the Council of the Secretary of State and the ban on members of the Indian Civil Service from occupying political positions in government. Unlike many other Indian Historical Constitutions, this document contained no articulations of rights. Hugh Owen in ‘Negotiating the Lucknow Pact’ (The Journal of Asian Studies, 1972), argues that the Congress-League Scheme 1916 ‘ushered in a period of Hindu Muslim cooperation culminating in the Khilafat Agitation of 120-21’. While the document did garner attention, it did not manage to persuade the British in introducing self-government. It was overshadowed by ‘Montague-Chelmsford’ reforms that became the basis of the Government of India Act 1919. The British claimed this Act introduced self-government – leaders of the freedom movement disagreed.
