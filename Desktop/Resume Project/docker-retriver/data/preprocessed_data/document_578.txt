Summary Draft Article 80 (Article 100) was debated on 19 May 1949. It regulated the business of the Parliament concerning voting, quorum and vacancies. A member moved a few amendments to edit grammar and language of the Draft Article. In clause 1, he sought to delete ‘other than the Chairman or Speaker or person acting as such’. Before ‘The Chairman’, he proposed to add ‘Provided that’. He believed that the Draft Article must be relieved from ‘needless verbiage’. Another member generally commented that he was against the principle of conducting joint sittings of the Parliament. He hoped that the Assembly would drop it from the Draft Article. The above-mentioned proposals were voted out. The Assembly adopted the Draft Article on 19 May 1949.
