SUMMARY Draft Article 299 was taken up for discussion on 26 August 1949 and 14 October 1949. This Draft Article empowered the President and Governor to appoint a special officer for minorities at the Union and State level. These officers would deal with constitutional safeguards provided for minorities. A report would be prepared on the implementation of the safeguards and submitted to the President or Governor respectively. These reports would then be submitted before Parliament and State legislatures. The Drafting Committee Chairman proposed to have only one minorities officer at the Union level. He believed that since minorities groups covered under the safeguards had been reduced, there was no need for a complex enforcement mechanism. It was urged by some Members that the Draft Article be discussed at a later stage when there is clarity on which minorities are given protection in the Constitution. The President felt that this Draft Article covers all minorities and therefore is not subject to the Assembly’s decision on who are considered minorities. However, to prevent repetition of discussion on this issue, he postponed the debate on Draft Article 299. Since the beneficiaries of protections under the Constitution had been finalised, Draft Article 299 was taken up for discussion again on 14 October 1949. This time, the Drafting Committee proposed to replace the provision for appointing a special officer for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities to analyse the implementation of the constitutional safeguards for the community. It also covered other backward classes that the President may include and Anglo-Indians. Two Members were concerned that the Draft Article does not mention what action Parliament should take based on the report. They wanted an explicit provision to empower Parliament to take action based on the President’s submission. However, it was clarified that Parliament has the general power to take action based on submissions made before it. A member opposed the inclusion of backward classes in the Draft Article. He believed it was a vague term and would impose difficulties on the President to identify such communities. The Assembly did not address this objection. A Member from a minority committee proposed to revert to the provision as mentioned in the Draft Article – a special officer to be appointed at the Union and State level for implementing safeguards for minorities. A Member responded that having officers at different levels would be complicated and that it was agreed by the Assembly that special safeguards will be given only to SC/ST communities. The Assembly accepted the Drafting Committee’s amendment and rejected the others. Draft Article 299 (as amended) was adopted on 14 October 1949. Article 338 was amended in 2003 to set-up a national commission instead of a special officer for Scheduled Castes. In 2018, Article 338 was amended again, to remove backward classes from its ambit.
