Biography


Early Life
Kuladhar Chaliha was born on 20 September 1887 in Lakhimpur district of Assam. He studied at Cotton College, Guwahati as well as Presidency College, Calcutta.
Role in Indian Independence Movement
Chaliha occupied key posts in the Indian National Congress and State and Central legislatures. He was the first President of Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (1920) and a member of the All-India Congress Committee (1921 – 44). His legislative career included memberships of the Assam Council and the Central Legislative Assembly (1936-46). Like many of his Congress Party colleagues, Chaliha was imprisoned for his involvement in the Indian freedom movement.
Contribution to Constitution Making
Chaliha was elected to the Constituent Assembly from Assam on a Congress Party ticket. His interventions in the Assembly mostly revolved around the administration of tribal areas.
Later Contributions
Soon after the independence, Chaliha became the Speaker of the Assam Legislative Assembly (1952-1957).
He passed away on 19 January 1963.
The Government of India issued a postage stamp in 1988 on the occasion of his birth centenary.


 



Key Speeches



Chaliha believed that the Sixth Schedule would create more rift between tribal communities and the rest of India.
He felt that tribal people of Assam were not capable of framing rules for self-government and local administration.
When the Constitution-making process was winding up, he specifically singled out the Constitution’s Directive Principles of State Policy for praise and appreciation.
