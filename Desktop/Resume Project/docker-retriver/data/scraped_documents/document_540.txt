Summary


Draft Article 153 (Article 174) was debated on 2nd June 1949. It laid down the rules relating to the sessions of State Legislatures.
One member proposed an amendment to clause (2)(c) allowing the Governor to dissolve the Legislative Assembly only if he ‘is satisfied that administration is failing and the ministry has become unstable‘. He contended that if the Constitution did not enumerate the circumstances under which a House could be dissolved, there was a possibility that the Governor could dissolve it for political reasons. This was rejected by the Assembly with little debate.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to delete clause (3) altogether, as it was ‘inconsistent with the scheme for a Constitutional Governor’. This was accepted by the Assembly.
The amended Draft Article was adopted on 2nd June 1949.
