Summary


Draft Article 26 was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 9 December 1948. It empowers Parliament to make laws that would restrict the application of fundamental rights to a specific category of people, including members of the Armed Forces and intelligence organisations.
There was no substantive debate around this article. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved a minor amendment to the language of the Article to bring it in conformity with the rest of Part III. The Assembly adopted the Draft Article with this single, minor amendment on 9 December 1948.
