Summary


Draft Article 179 (Article 204) was debated on 10 June 1949. It laid down the procedure for the passage of Appropriation Bills.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee moved an amendment to wholly replace the Draft Article with the following:
1) As soon as may be after the grant under the last preceding article have been made by the Assembly there shall be introduced a Bill to provide for the appropriation out of the Consolidated Fund of the State all moneys required to meet-
(a) the grants so made by the Assembly; and
(b) the expenditure charged on the consolidated Fund of the State but not exceeding in any case the amount shown in the statement previously laid before the House or Houses.
(2) No amendment shall be proposed to any such bill in the House or either House of the Legislature of the State which will have the effect of varying the amount or altering the destination of any grant so made or of varying the amount of any expenditure charged on the Consolidated fund of the State, and the decision of the person presiding as to the amendments which are admissible under this clause shall be final.
(3) Subject to the provisions of the next two succeeding articles no money shall be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of the State except under appropriation made by law passed in accordance with the provisions of this article.
The Draft Article empowered the Governor to authenticate the Schedule. Through this Amendment, the Drafting Committee sought to give primacy to the State Legislature. The amendment was accepted without debate.
The amended Draft Article was adopted on 10 June 1949.
