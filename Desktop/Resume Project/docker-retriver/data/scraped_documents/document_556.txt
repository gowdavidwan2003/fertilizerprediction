Summary


Draft Article 136 (Article 159) was debated on 31st May 1949. It set out the oath or affirmation to be taken by a Governor before taking office.
A member of the Drafting Committee proposed an amendment to require the Governor to make his affirmation or oath in the presence of the Chief Justice of the relevant High Court, rather than members of the State Legislature. He argued that this amendment would mirror the language of Draft Article 49 (Article 60) which set out the affirmation or oath sworn by the President.
A member proposed to amend the Draft Article to allow oath-takers to ‘swear in the name of God’. He pointed out that a similar amendment had been accepted to Draft Article 49.
Both amendments were endorsed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee and accepted by the Assembly without debate. The amended Draft Article was adopted on 31st May 1949.
