Biography


Early Life
Yudhishthir Mishra was born on 17 August 1916 in Chhatamkhara, Patna State, in modern day Odisha. He completed his education from Ravenshaw College, Cuttack and Patna Law College, Bihar. Mishra served as the Secretary of the Bihar Students Federation (1940-1941) and practised as an advocate in the Orissa High Court.
Role in the Indian Independence Movement
Not much is known about Mishra’s involvement in India’s freedom struggle.
Contribution to Constitution Making
Mishra represented the Eastern Princely States (Orissa) in the Constituent Assembly. He did not actively participate in the Assembly debates, but made important interventions on a couple of occasions, speaking on the plight of the people in the Princely States.
Later Contributions
Mishra served as the President of the Patna State Krushak Party and the President of the Patna State District Congress Committee. He was also a member of the Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee and the Orissa State Assembly.


 



Key Speeches



On 5 January 1949, Mishra raised the issue of the plight of the people in the Princely States of Orissa, including the lack of finances and autonomy. He criticised the award of privy purses to the princes without ascertaining the will of the people.
On 5 September 1949, Mishra moved several amendments to the Fifth Schedule that would have had the effect of empowering them further against executive interference.
