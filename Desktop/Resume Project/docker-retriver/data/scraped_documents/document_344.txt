SUMMARY


Draft Article 304 was debated in the Constituent Assembly on 17 September 1949. It granted the exclusive power to amend the Constitution to Parliament and outlined the procedure for exercising this power. According to the Draft Article, an amendment required the approval of a two-thirds majority in Parliament and, in some cases, the consent of half of India’s states.
During the debate, the Drafting Committee Chairman moved an amendment that tightened the language of the Draft Article and increased the number of Articles requiring the consent of India’s states for their amendment.
Most Assembly members who participated in the debate opposed the two-thirds majority requirement and favoured a “simple majority.” They believed that the Draft Article made it difficult, if not impossible, to amend the Constitution. These members presented various reasons why a rigid Constitution was not desirable. They argued that a rigid Constitution would hinder progressive legislation, limit the Constitution’s ability to adapt to social and political uncertainties, and was not justified given the Constituent Assembly’s modest representative credentials.
There was also a concern that the involvement of States in the amendment process would weaken the supremacy of the Union Parliament and impede future attempts to modify India’s federal structure if Parliament wished to do so.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded by reminding members that other Draft Articles provided for amendments by a simple majority and that Draft Article 304 concerned a special category of articles requiring a higher threshold for amendment. He cited the amendment provisions of Ireland, Switzerland, Australia, and the United States to demonstrate that no major Constitution in the world allowed all parts of the Constitution to be amended by a simple majority. He also reiterated that the involvement of States in the amendment process was necessary to protect their interests.
In the end, only the Chairman of the Drafting Committee’s amendment was accepted by the Assembly.
Originally titled “Procedure for the Amendment of the Constitution” in the Constitution of India 1050, this Article was later renamed after the Supreme Court’s Golaknath case of 1967, which limited Parliament’s authority to amend Fundamental Rights. In response, Parliament enacted the Constitution (Twenty-fourth Amendment) Act in 1971, which added two clauses to bring Fundamental Rights under Parliament’s amending power. In the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case of 1973, the Supreme Court upheld Parliament’s power to amend all parts of the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights. However, the court also established the doctrine that Parliament could not amend the basic structure of the Constitution.
