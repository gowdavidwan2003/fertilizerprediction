Article
46



Promotion of educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other weaker sections

The State shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation.



 
 

Version 1




Article 37, Draft Constitution of India 1948
The State shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the scheduled tribes, and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation.
 




Version 2


Article 46, constitution of India 1950
The Slate shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation.




Summary


Draft Article 37 (Article 46) was discussed on 23 November 1948. It aims to promote education and economic interests for members of Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and other weaker sections.
The central issue of the discussion was around the scope of the term ‘Scheduled Castes’. One member moved to substitute ‘Scheduled Castes‘ with ‘Backward communities of whatever class or religion‘. He argued that the definition of Scheduled Castes is restrictive and does not cover several backward communities like Sikh, Ramdasis, Odes, Balmiki, and Chamars. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee remarked that this amendment was unnecessary at this juncture. It could be considered while discussing the schedule which lists down the Scheduled Castes.
The Assembly adopted this Article without amendments on the same day, that is 23 November 1948.
