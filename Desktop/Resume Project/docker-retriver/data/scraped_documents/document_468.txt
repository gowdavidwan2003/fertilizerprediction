Summary


Draft Article 291-A (Article 329 of Constitution of India 1950) was absent in the Draft Constitution of India 1948. The Drafting Committee Chairman introduced this Draft Article on 16 June 1949. Draft Article 291-A prohibits the judiciary from examining the validity of laws on delimitation of and allotting seats to constituencies. Further, it stated that challenges to election of MPs and MLAs can only be made under a law passed by Parliament or state legislatures.
The Drafting Committee Chairman proposed to remove the clause which clarified that the law passed by Parliament or state legislatures could include a provision to determine the finality of proceedings challenging an election at any stage.
The Assembly accepted the amendment without any debate and adopted Draft Article 291-A on the same day.
