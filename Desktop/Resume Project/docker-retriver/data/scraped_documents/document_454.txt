(2) The President, in the case of the Union Commission or a Joint Commission, and the Governor in the case of a State Commission, may suspend from office the Chairman or any other member of the Commission in respect of whom a reference has been made to the Supreme Court under clause (1) until the President has passed orders on receipt of the report of the Supreme Court on such reference.
(3) Notwithstanding anything in clause (1), the President may by order remove from office the Chairman or any other member of a Public Service Commission if the Chairman or such other member, as the case may be,—

Summary


Draft Article 285A (Article 317 of Constitution of India 1950) was not included in the Draft Constitution 1948. It was introduced by the Drafting Committee Chairman on 22 August 1949. It laid down the manner in which a member of a Public Service Commission may be suspended or removed. The President was empowered to remove a member of a Public Service Commission in two instances – (i) proof of misbehaviour and (ii) automatic disqualification. The grounds for automatic disqualification were (i) being declared insolvent, (ii) infirmity of mind or body or (ii) taking up any other employment during the period of membership with the Public Service Commission.
A Member felt that the phrase ‘shall only be removed’ should be replaced with ‘may be removed’. The Assembly did not discuss this suggestion.
Another Member proposed that the phrase ‘misbehaviour or of infirmity of mind or body’, be substituted with the words ‘misdemeanour or incapacity’ as the phrase was colloquial. The Assembly rejected this amendment without any debate.
The Draft Article was adopted on the same day.
