Summary


Draft Article 65 (Article 78) was debated on 7 January 1949. This article made the Prime Minister responsible for official communications to the President.
One member moved an amendment to insert ‘as soon as they are made’ in clause (a): this would ensure that the President was made aware of the Ministers’ decision at the earliest and prevent delay and procrastination. However, the mover of the amendment, generally commenting on this article, was not convinced of its necessity. This was a matter of routine business and could be a part of the Rules of Business of the Cabinet.
The Assembly adopted the Draft Article without any amendments on 7 January 1949.
