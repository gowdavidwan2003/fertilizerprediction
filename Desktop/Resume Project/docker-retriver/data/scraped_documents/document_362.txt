Summary


Draft Article 63 (Article 76) was debated on 7 January 1949. This article regulated the office of Attorney-General for India.
A member moved an amendment which would require the Attorney-General to resign upon the resignation of the Prime Minister. He argued that the Constitution mandated the Advocate-General in the states to resign upon the Chief Minister’s resignation. Hence, a similar provision needed to be made for the Attorney-General. He argued that the Attorney-General and the Advocate-General must have the same footing in the Constitution. Moreover, England had a similar precedent.
There was another proposal which would make the remuneration of the Attorney-General subject to the law made by the Parliament, instead of the President. This would ensure a consistent salary that would not be subject to the discretion of the President.
The Assembly did not accept any of these proposals. It adopted the Draft Article without any amendments on 7 January 1949.
