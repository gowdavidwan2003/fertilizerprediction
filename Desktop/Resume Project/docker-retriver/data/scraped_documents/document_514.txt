Article 223, Constitution of India 1950
When the office of Chief Justice of a High Court is vacant or when any such Chief Justice is, by reason of absence or otherwise, unable to perform the duties of his office, the duties of the office shall be performed by such one of the other Judges of the Court as the President may appoint for the purpose.




Summary


Draft Article 198 (Article 223) was debated on 7th June 1949. It laid down the procedure to fill vacancies in the High Courts.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed that the Article should read as follows:
‘When the office of Chief Justice of a High Court is vacant or when any such Chief Justice is, by reason of absence or otherwise, unable to perform the duties of his office the duties of the office shall be performed by such one of the other judges of the court, as the President, may appoint for the purpose.’
The amendment limited the scope of the Article so that it only applied to vacancies in the office of Chief Justice. It was adopted without debate.
The amended Draft Article was adopted on 7th June 1949.
