Biography


Early Life
Annie Mascarene was born on 6th  June  1902 at Trivandrum. She obtained a double M.A. in history and economics from Colleges for Arts and Law, Trivandrum and went on to become a lecturer in Sri Lanka. After her return to Trivandrum, she procured a law degree.
She was a member of the Travancore-Cochin Legislative Assembly between 1948 and 1952 where she served briefly as a Minister in charge of Health and Power.
Contribution to Constitution Making
Mascarene represented the Princely State of Travancore and Cochin Union in the Constituent Assembly. In the Assembly, she spoke on the issue of federalism.
Later Contributions
Mascarene was elected to the first Lok Sabha as an independent candidate. She was the first woman from Kerala to have been elected to the Lok Sabha where she raised concerns about under-representation of women in politics. Her political career took a hit after her unsuccessful attempt in the 1957 Lok Sabha elections.


 



Key Speeches
