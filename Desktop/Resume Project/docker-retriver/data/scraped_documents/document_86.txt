Key Speeches



Sharma opposed the need to include contempt of court as a limitation to free speech since India already had contempt of court laws.
He believed that Draft Article 112 (Article 136) was a safeguard to guarantee that justice was delivered in cases of civil or criminal matters.
Taking inspiration from the United States, Sharma argued that judges of the Indian Supreme Court must be appointed by the President in consultation with the ministers.
