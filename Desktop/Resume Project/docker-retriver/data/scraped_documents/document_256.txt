Summary


Draft Article 162A (Article 185) was debated on 2 June 1949. It was not included in the Draft Constitution, 1948. It prevented the Chairman from presiding over a sitting while a resolution for his removal was being considered, and imposed a similar restriction on the Deputy Chairman.
A member proposed the insertion of the following provision:
‘162-A. At any sitting of the Legislative Council of a State, while any resolution for the removal of the Chairman from his office is under consideration, the Chairman, or while any resolution for the removal of the Deputy Chairman from his office is under consideration, the Deputy Chairman, shall not, though he is present, preside, and the provisions of clause (2) of the last preceding article shall apply in relation to every such sitting as they apply in relation to a sitting from which the Chairman or, as the case may be, the Deputy Chairman is absent.‘
He pointed out that a similar provision had just been adopted as Draft Article 159A (Article 181).
The Draft Article was adopted without any debate on 2nd June 1949.
